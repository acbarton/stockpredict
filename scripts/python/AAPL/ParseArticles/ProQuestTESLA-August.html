<p>The Silicon Valley car maker, which this month announced plans to build its first overseas plant in China, has had preliminary discussions with two German states vying to host a Tesla Gigafactory to build electric cars and their batteries under one roof, officials involved in the talks said.</p>
<p>The talks with Rhineland Palatinate and Saarland are still in their early stages, and might not yield an agreement, the officials said.</p>
<p>Tesla has also discussed building the plant in the Netherlands, said a Dutch government official, who declined to say if that option is still being pursued. Tesla's European headquarters is in the Netherlands, where it also has a facility that prepares for local sale vehicles built in California.</p>
<p>Tesla declined to comment.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Elon Musk in June suggested Tesla would likely announce a factory location in Europe by year-end, later saying in a Twitter post that Germany was a "leading choice."</p>
<p>He said it would make sense to build the plant near Belgium and Luxembourg along the German-French border, positioning it near Tesla's most important markets in Europe.</p>
<p>Tesla assembles most of its vehicles in Fremont, Calif., and makes batteries at the company's factory outside of Reno, Nev. Mr. Musk wants to accelerate global expansion by adding manufacturing capacity in China and Europe -- the world's two biggest regions for electric-car sales.</p>
<p>Tesla's proposed China plant will have the capacity to manufacture 500,000 vehicles a year, a large factory by auto-industry standards, and that has European officials hoping Tesla has similar ambitions for Europe.</p>
<p>Discussions about a Gigafactory for Europe come as Tesla boosts production in the face of a surge in new plug-in electric models from other auto makers, including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG, BMW AG, Renault-Nissan and Jaguar.</p>
<p>Tesla is accelerating production of its Model 3 compact sedan and is preparing a compact sport-utility vehicle, to be called the Model Y. Those two vehicles could help transform Tesla from a niche luxury brand into a mass-market car company.</p>
<p>Officials in Rhineland Palatinate and Saarland, which border France, had been lobbying Tesla for some time. After Mr. Musk's tweet last month, they stepped up their efforts with phone calls and written invitations to Mr. Musk.</p>
<p>"We have done everything possible to assure that Rhineland Palatinate is in the competition for the plant," said Ralph Schleimer, a state official involved in the lobbying. He said the state has presented its case to Tesla, but that detailed negotiations haven't begun.</p>
<p>Tesla acquired a robotics maker in Rhineland Palatinate last year. The company, now called Tesla Grohmann Automation, builds equipment for Tesla's Nevada factory.</p>
<p>Saarland officials approached Tesla in March, then reached out again last month, said Anke Rehlinger, the state's economics minister. In early July, Tesla agreed to meet, she said.</p>

<p>The results should give Chief Executive Elon Musk some wiggle room to prove that a continued production rate of more than 5,000 Model 3s a week
  during the third quarter can make the auto maker cash-flow positive and profitable--a promise he made earlier this year and reiterated Wednesday in a letter to shareholders, though many analysts doubt is possible.</p>
<p>"It took 15 years to execute on our initial goal to produce an affordable, long-range electric vehicle that can also be highly profitable," Mr. Musk said. "In the second half of 2018, we expect, for the first time in our history, to become both sustainably profitable and cash flow positive."</p>
<p>Tesla finished the second quarter with $2.2 billion of cash. Its negative free cash flow of about $740 million was lower than a consensus of analysts expected. The company has previously said it needed to keep a minimum cash balance of $1 billion, and several analysts have said Tesla will need to raise more money while Mr. Musk has said he doesn't want to.</p>
<p>Tesla reiterated it expected to produce 6,000 Model 3s sedans in a week by late August. "We then expect to increase production over the next few quarters beyond 6,000 per week, while keeping additional [capital expenditures] limited," Tesla said in the shareholder letter.</p>
<p>The company said it planned to build 50,000 to 55,000 of the sedans during the third quarter and that it remained on target to make a total of 100,000 Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles for the year.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley auto maker on Wednesday reported a quarterly loss of $717.5 million compared with $336.4 million a year ago. The period marked Tesla's seventh consecutive quarterly loss.</p>
<p>Tesla's stock rose about 4.5% in after-hours trading to $314.29. The shares were down more than 3% this year ahead of Tesla's quarterly report.</p>
<p>Tesla reached the long-delayed goal of making 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a single week during the final days of June. Now the test is whether it can sustain that production to generate necessary cash and eventually prove it is no longer a niche luxury brand but one capable of building millions of cars a year.</p>
<p>Tesla came under intense scrutiny during the second quarter as the company rushed to meet the twice-delayed 5,000-a-week goal, a rate that analysts say should help Tesla generate positive cash flow and reach profitability. The company slashed 9% of its workforce in June
 , and Mr. Musk promised a management reorganization after his engineering chief stepped aside
 .</p>
<p>The company on Wednesday cut back further on planned capital expenditures as part of a strategy to focus building out its existing infrastructure for making the Model 3. It now plans to spend less than $2.5 billion this year, lower than a $3 billion projection in May, which itself was down from the $3.4 billion previously announced and spent last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's comments later Wednesday on a public conference call with analysts will be closely watched by investors curious about his mood and tone following last quarter's conference call when he sparred with analysts
 .</p>
<p>Revenue during the second quarter rose to $4 billion. That compares with $2.79 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Tesla said last month that total vehicle deliveries reached 40,740, a dramatic increase from more than 22,000 vehicles a year earlier thanks to increased production of the Model 3 sedan. Tesla sold about 18,440 Model 3s during the period.</p>

Second-quarter results
  suggest meeting those goals is urgent.</p>
<p>Tesla reported sales of $4 billion, topping analyst estimates, and an adjusted loss of $3.06 a share, which missed them. Shares were up 11% in extended trading Wednesday.</p>
<p>The positives for shareholders come with strings attached: Free cash outflow was $739 million, a significant improvement from the first quarter. But part of that came from once again stretching what Tesla owes suppliers
 . Accounts payable ballooned in the quarter and now exceeds $3 billion.</p>
<p>The company ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of just $2.2 billion. More than $900 million of that is comprised of generally refundable customer deposits.</p>
<p>Earning a profit and generating cash flow in the next two quarters does seem possible. Tesla can sell regulatory credits to boost margins, and it built thousands of Model 3 sedans in late June which weren't sold until the third quarter began.</p>
<p>But Tesla may be sacrificing long-term goals to hit more immediate milestones. It cut its capital spending forecast for the second consecutive quarter and now expects to spend less than $2.5 billion this year. The company announced it would lay off 9% of its workforce back in June. Lower investment and head count helps preserve cash in the short term, but they don't underpin Tesla's stratospheric valuation, which assumes future auto industry dominance. The company's earnings release made no mention of projects such as the Model Y and electric truck.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Elon Musk has said Tesla doesn't need to raise capital this year, putting him at odds with analysts at Moody's Investors Service
 . If he reverses himself, a stock price back above $300 will at least make that less painful for current shareholders.</p>

<p>The results, which sent Tesla's shares soaring in after-hours trading Wednesday, should give Chief Executive Elon Musk some wiggle room to prove that a continued production rate of more than 5,000 Model 3s a week
  during the third quarter can make the auto maker cash-flow positive and profitable. He made that promise earlier this year and reiterated it Wednesday in a letter to shareholders, though many analysts doubt it can be kept.</p>
<p>Tesla more than doubled its loss from last year's second quarter to $717.5 million, its seventh consecutive quarterly loss during an period intensely focused on ramping up production of the Model 3. Tesla reached the long-delayed goal of making 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a single week during the final days of June. Now the test is whether it can sustain that production to generate necessary cash and eventually prove it is no longer a niche luxury brand but one capable of building millions of cars a year.</p>
<p>"It took 15 years to execute on our initial goal to produce an affordable, long-range electric vehicle that can also be highly profitable," Mr. Musk wrote in Wednesday's shareholder letter. "In the second half of 2018, we expect, for the first time in our history, to become both sustainably profitable and cash flow positive."</p>
<p>Later on a call with analysts, Mr. Musk said he expects Tesla will record a profit in all subsequent quarters--except perhaps if the economy collapses or the company pays back a big loan, he said.</p>
<p>If Mr. Musk begins to fulfill that promise, he could calm investors and analysts concerned by Tesla's dwindling cash pile. Mr. Musk has bristled at the idea of raising more cash, and on Wednesday told analysts he doesn't plan to issue new equity.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Musk said he plans to focus on paying down the company's debt--not refinancing it. He expects a new factory proposed for Shanghai
  will cost $2 billion and will be financed with debt in China.</p>
<p>"Are we running low on money? The answer is no," Mr. Musk said on the call. His tone of the call differed greatly from the prior quarter when he sparred with analysts, sending shares plummeting. Mr. Musk apologized to those analysts on the call Wednesday and generally sounded upbeat--if tired.</p>
<p>Tesla finished the second quarter with $2.2 billion of cash. Its negative free cash flow of about $740 million was lower than what a consensus of analysts expected. The company previously said it needed to keep a minimum cash balance of $1 billion, and several analysts had said Tesla would need to raise more money.</p>
<p>The quarterly report, and Mr. Musk's subsequent comments, sent Tesla's shares up nearly 9% to $327.70 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The shares were down more than 3% this year ahead of Tesla's quarterly report.</p>
<p>"I was expecting more cash burn, possibly even a severe one because there were a lot of production costs at the end of the quarter to meet the 5,000/week target but many of those vehicles likely were not delivered until Q3," David Whiston, an analyst for Morningstar Research Services, wrote.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk remains optimistic that Tesla can make 1 million vehicles in 2020, though he expressed new caution saying it "seems pretty likely" the company will make 700,000 to 800,000 that year. He said Tesla's Fremont, Calif., assembly plant and Nevada battery factory should be able to produce about 600,000 a year plus 100,000 to 200,000 at the new Shanghai facility, which is supposed to begin production that year.</p>
<p>The company had previously said it would begin China production in 2020 while in Tesla's shareholder letter the company said the first cars would roll off the line in about three years, which would put it at 2021.</p>
<p>Tesla reiterated it expects to produce 6,000 Model 3s sedans in a week by late August. The company said it plans to build 50,000 to 55,000 of the sedans during the third quarter and that it remains on target to make a total of 100,000 Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles for the year.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has sought to cut costs in the pursuit of profitability. The company slashed 9% of its workforce
  in June, and Mr. Musk promised a management reorganization after his engineering chief stepped
  aside.</p>
<p>The company on Wednesday cut back further on planned capital expenditures as part of a strategy to focus building out its existing infrastructure for making the Model 3. It now plans to spend less than $2.5 billion this year, lower than a $3 billion projection in May, which itself was down from the $3.4 billion previously announced and spent last year.</p>
<p>Revenue during the second quarter rose 44% to $4 billion. Tesla said last month that total vehicle deliveries reached 40,740, a dramatic increase from more than 22,000 vehicles a year earlier thanks to increased production of the Model 3 sedan. Tesla sold about 18,440 Model 3s during the period.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Musk had a little fun with a prominent short seller. David Einhorn, the president of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, criticized Tesla and its CEO in a letter to investors Tuesday and wrote that he "is happy that his Model S lease ended" and was "happy to switch to an electric Jaguar."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter: "Tragic. Will send Einhorn a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time."</p>

<p>Tesla says it expects to make a profit and generate cash in the third and fourth quarters. Second-quarter results suggest meeting those goals is urgent.</p>
<p>Tesla reported sales of $4 billion, topping analyst estimates, and an adjusted loss of $3.06 a share, which missed them.</p>
<p>The positives for shareholders come with strings attached: Free cash outflow was $739 million, a significant improvement from the first quarter. But part of that came from again stretching what Tesla owes suppliers. Accounts payable ballooned in the quarter and now exceeds $3 billion.</p>
<p>Earning a profit and generating cash flow in the next two quarters does seem possible. Tesla can sell regulatory credits to boost margins, and it built thousands of Model 3 sedans in late June which weren't sold until the third quarter began.</p>
<p>But Tesla may be sacrificing long-term goals to hit more immediate milestones. It cut its capital spending forecast for the second consecutive quarter and now expects to spend less than $2.5 billion this year. The company announced it would lay off 9% of its workforce back in June. Lower investment and head count helps preserve cash in the short term, but they don't underpin Tesla's stratospheric valuation, which assumes future auto-industry dominance.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Elon Musk has said Tesla doesn't need to raise capital this year, putting him at odds with analysts at Moody's Investors Service. If he reverses himself, a stock price back above $300 will at least make that less painful for current shareholders.</p>

</p>
<p>He got it. Tesla shares jumped nearly 4% that day, leading some short sellers--investors who bet on price declines by borrowing shares, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and pocket the difference--to trim their positions, though Mr. Wick said he held tight.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has been engaged for some time in a digital cat-and-mouse fight with negative investors on his company's stock, and so far he is often winning. His extraordinary use of Twitter to battle short sellers has often been followed by a jump in Tesla's stock price, hurting shorts in the process.</p>
<p>On Thursday, short sellers suffered a $1.7 billion loss, according to S3 Partners, after Tesla's results showed it burned through less cash than investors had expected in the second quarter. Tesla shares jumped 16% to $349.54, notching their biggest one-day gain since 2013 which would wipe out the 2018 profits of short sellers who had been holding their positions since Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Kamran Mumtaz, a Tesla spokesman, responded to questions about this article by sending an emoji with a smiling face and waving hands and declined to elaborate on what it meant or to comment further. Mr. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>On June 17, Mr. Musk again took aim at bearish investors in a tweet that said
  such investors had "about three weeks before their short position explodes." The stock rose 4% the first day of trading after Mr. Musk's weekend tweet.</p>
<p>Tesla shares have declined more than 11% since then, even after a surge in after-hours trading Wednesday, when the company reassured investors
  that it would post a profit later this year and was burning less cash that expected.</p>
<p>Earlier in the morning Wednesday, before Tesla issued its quarterly report, Mr. Musk poked fun at David Einhorn, the prominent short seller who this week told investors his hedge fund's performance had been hurt by, among other things, a bearish Tesla position. Mr. Einhorn also wrote he had let his lease end on his Model S and switched to a competing Jaguar.</p>
<p>In response to an article about Mr. Einhorn's comments, Mr. Musk tweeted
  he would send the hedge fund billionaire a box of "short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time."</p>
<p>Tesla is among the most heavily shorted stocks on the market, with about 34 million shares--or about 20% of its total shares outstanding--sold short. Mr. Musk's use of Twitter to fight them and others is unparalleled among CEOs.</p>
<p>As of mid-July, Mr. Musk has tweeted 1,256 times this year, or about six times a day, on an array of topics, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.
  The analysis found the number of his tweets has increased each year since 2014, making him the second-most active technology-industry CEO on Twitter, after Salesforce.com's Marc Benioff. Unlike other CEOs, the bulk of Mr. Musk's tweets are responses to other users.</p>
<p>Some CEOs over the years who have publicly battled short sellers haven't fared well. Gene Munster, managing partner of investment and research firm Loup Ventures, suggested last month in an open letter to Mr. Musk that he take a "Twitter sabbatical," adding: "When companies aggressively engage with short sellers they lose."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's use of Twitter surged in May when Tesla neared a deadline for production of its Model 3 car, as he engaged in more contentious exchanges with his critics in the media and stock market.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's taunts of short sellers go back several years. In 2017, Tesla shares were up 30% for the year when, on April 3 of that year, Mr. Musk tweeted
  "Stormy weather in Shortville." Tesla shares rose $5 that day.</p>
<p>Barclays PLC research analyst Brian Johnson has written about Mr. Musk's tweets in his reports, saying in April 2017 that Tesla stock "seems to be more driven by 'cult' psychology and the flow of tweets."</p>
<p>In September 2017, Mr. Johnson made a tongue-in-cheek note of the idea of Tesla's "return on tweet," saying he was refining that analysis as "the ultimate Tesla valuation tool."</p>
<p>Quantopian Inc., a Boston-based quantitative asset management firm, analyzed the sentiment of Mr. Musk's tweets between May 2016 and July 2018 and built a trading model based on the data.</p>
<p>Quantopian found in general that investors could make money--albeit not much--by buying shares when its computer model detected a shift toward a positive tone in Mr. Musk's tweets based on his language, and selling shares when the tone turned negative.</p>
<p>Other companies have run into trouble over the years after jousting publicly with investor critics. Boston Chicken filed for bankruptcy in 1998 after battling criticisms from short sellers; last month, MiMedx Group Inc.'s Chief Executive Parker "Pete" Petit departed amid multiple investigations
  into the skin-graft company's financial practices, following his public criticism of those who bet against the company's stock.</p>
<p>MiMedx said its board's audit committee is conducting an independent investigation into "certain sales and distribution practices and other matters." The CEO has denied employee allegations of improper sales practices.</p>

</p>
<p>He got it. Tesla shares jumped nearly 4% that day, leading some short sellers--investors who bet on price declines by borrowing shares, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and pocket the difference--to trim their positions, though Mr. Wick said he held tight.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has been engaged for some time in a digital cat-and-mouse fight with negative investors on his company's stock, and so far he is often winning. His extraordinary use of Twitter to battle short sellers has often been followed by a jump in Tesla's stock price, hurting shorts in the process.</p>
<p>On Thursday, short sellers suffered a $1.7 billion loss, according to S3 Partners, after Tesla's results cheered investors, boosting the company's shares.</p>
<p>Kamran Mumtaz, a Tesla spokesman, responded to questions about this article by sending an emoji with a smiling face and waving hands and declined to elaborate on what it meant or to comment further. Mr. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>On June 17, Mr. Musk again took aim at bearish investors in a tweet that said
  such investors had "about three weeks before their short position explodes." The stock rose 4% the first day of trading after Mr. Musk's weekend tweet.</p>
<p>Tesla shares began a long decline after that but yesterday made a big reversal, closing at $349.54, up 16%. The gain came on volume of 23 million shares and was its largest percentagewise since December 2013. Mr. Musk also apologized for the prior quarter's conference call when he derided analysts about their questions of the company.</p>
<p>Earlier in the morning Wednesday, before Tesla issued its quarterly report, Mr. Musk poked fun at David Einhorn, the prominent short seller who this week told investors his hedge fund's performance had been hurt by, among other things, a bearish Tesla position. Mr. Einhorn also wrote he had let his lease end on his Model S and switched to a competing Jaguar.</p>
<p>In response to an article about Mr. Einhorn's comments, Mr. Musk tweeted
  he would send the hedge fund billionaire a box of "short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time."</p>
<p>Tesla is among the most heavily shorted stocks on the market, with about 34 million shares--or about 20% of its total shares outstanding--sold short. Mr. Musk's use of Twitter to fight them and others is unparalleled among CEOs.</p>
<p>As of mid-July, Mr. Musk has tweeted 1,256 times this year, or about six times a day, on an array of topics, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.
  The analysis found the number of his tweets has increased each year since 2014, making him the second-most active technology-industry CEO on Twitter, after Salesforce.com's Marc Benioff. Unlike other CEOs, the bulk of Mr. Musk's tweets are responses to other users.</p>
<p>Some CEOs over the years who have publicly battled short sellers haven't fared well. Gene Munster, managing partner of investment and research firm Loup Ventures, suggested last month in an open letter to Mr. Musk that he take a "Twitter sabbatical," adding: "When companies aggressively engage with short sellers they lose."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's use of Twitter surged in May when Tesla neared a deadline for production of its Model 3 car, as he engaged in more contentious exchanges with his critics in the media and stock market.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's taunts of short sellers go back several years. In 2017, Tesla shares were up 30% for the year when, on April 3 of that year, Mr. Musk tweeted
  "Stormy weather in Shortville." Tesla shares rose $5 that day.</p>
<p>Barclays PLC research analyst Brian Johnson has written about Mr. Musk's tweets in his reports, saying in April 2017 that Tesla stock "seems to be more driven by 'cult' psychology and the flow of tweets."</p>
<p>In September 2017, Mr. Johnson made a tongue-in-cheek note of the idea of Tesla's "return on tweet," saying he was refining that analysis as "the ultimate Tesla valuation tool."</p>
<p>Quantopian Inc., a Boston-based quantitative asset management firm, analyzed the sentiment of Mr. Musk's tweets between May 2016 and July 2018 and built a trading model based on the data.</p>
<p>Quantopian found in general that investors could make money--albeit not much--by buying shares when its computer model detected a shift toward a positive tone in Mr. Musk's tweets based on his language, and selling shares when the tone turned negative.</p>
<p>Other companies have run into trouble over the years after jousting publicly with investor critics. Boston Chicken filed for bankruptcy in 1998 after battling criticisms from short sellers. Last month, MiMedx Group Inc. Chief Executive Parker "Pete" Petit departed amid multiple investigations
  into the skin-graft company's financial practices, following his public criticism of those who bet against the company's stock.</p>
<p>MiMedx said its board's audit committee is conducting an independent investigation into "certain sales and distribution practices and other matters." The CEO has denied employee allegations of improper sales practices.</p>

<p>Heading into the electric car maker's earnings report Wednesday, investors who had placed wagers on Tesla shares falling had racked up about $10.5 billion in short interest--making Tesla the most shorted stock in the U.S. on a dollar basis, according to financial-analytics firm S3 Partners. Short sellers borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy back the shares at lower prices and then pocket the difference.</p>
<p>Those bets turned into a $1.7 billion loss Thursday after Tesla's results showed it burned through less cash than investors expected
 . Tesla shares jumped 16% to $349.54, notching their biggest one-day gain since 2013 and wiping out all of short sellers' profits for the year.</p>
<p>Despite the whiplash, there were few signs of naysayers rushing to dump their positions. As of Thursday morning, Tesla remained the most heavily shorted stock in the U.S., attracting $4 billion more short interest than the second-most shorted stock on the list, Apple Inc., according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. There were also relatively few buy to covers, or orders placed to buy shares to close out existing short positions, Mr. Dusaniwsky added.</p>
<p>For longtime Tesla skeptics, the reason was simple: Betting against Tesla has long been a volatile and money-losing trade, with the company's shares up more than 1,900% from its 2010 initial public offering price of $17. One post-earnings rally isn't enough to shake their conviction that the company, whose electric cars have upended the conventional automobile industry, is running through cash at an unsustainable pace.</p>
<p>"It's pounded my fund's performance over the last 18 months...but I don't let the stock price change how I feel about the company," said Mark Spiegel, who says his hedge fund, Stanphyl Capital, has been shorting Tesla for years and would continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Mr. Spiegel said he first began shorting Tesla around 2013, when its share price was trading in the high $90s. Once it got to around $200, "I thought, this is beyond ridiculous, and that's when I got a lot shorter," he said.</p>
<p>Wednesday's earnings report did little to impress Mr. Spiegel, who said he is troubled by competition from luxury auto makers that plan to roll out their own electric vehicles and issues with product delays, along with the pace at which the company has plowed through its cash. "I saw nothing in [Wednesday's] report that I didn't expect or that changes my opinion about the company," Mr. Spiegel said.</p>
<p>Other investors with short positions in Tesla have cited skepticism over whether the company would be able to contend with challenges including product delays, layoffs and competition for the firm's Models S and X vehicles.</p>
<p>Hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc.'s short position in Tesla, whose shares jumped 29% last quarter, was its second-biggest loser throughout that period, according to a letter the firm's president, David Einhorn, distributed to investors this week. Still, in his letter, Mr. Einhorn maintained that 2019 would likely be "a very challenging year" for Tesla, adding that he doubted "the entry-level Model 3 will be produced profitably anytime soon, if ever."</p>
<p>Tesla shorts still face a long road to profitability after the latest rally. Investors who had bet on shares sliding are down $1.4 billion year to date, data from S3 Partners show. Going back to 2016, Tesla shorts are down $6.4 billion, making it the third-worst-performing short over that time behind Nvidia and Amazon.com, according to S3 Partners.</p>
<p>Mr. Dusaniwsky said he believes those in the business of shorting Tesla shares long term would likely shrug off Thursday's more than $1 billion loss.</p>
<p>While it is possible short sellers with narrower time horizons are waiting for Tesla's stock to pare recent gains before closing out their positions, longer-term sellers have accumulated losses of billions of dollars in the past--and in response, not just held onto their positions but also expanded them, Mr. Dusaniwsky said.</p>
<p>"The ones who've lost billions of dollars, they're going to take it on the chin," Mr. Dusaniwsky said, adding that Tesla has been one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the U.S. for years. "No matter what is going on with the price and with earnings and car production, the major long-term short sellers are holding onto their short positions."</p>
<p>Tesla also continues to attract short sellers who own the firm's convertible bonds. Many of those investors take short positions in the company's stock as part of an "absolute return" strategy which tries to minimize the risks of the stock and the bonds; others short the stock to try to profit from inefficiencies between markets.</p>
<p>Tesla isn't the only high-profile tech stock investors are betting against. The eight most-shorted U.S. stocks are all in the technology industry, with Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Netflix Inc. rounding out the list of the top five most shorted U.S. companies, according to S3 Partners.</p>
<p>The bets reflect broad skepticism that technology companies, which have dominated the latest leg of the bull market, can continue meeting investors' lofty expectations. Disappointing results from Netflix sent the stock last month on its biggest one-day slide in years, while Facebook Inc. notched the worst-ever one-day loss in market cap for a publicly traded U.S. firm following its latest quarterly earnings report.</p>

<p>Heading into the electric-car maker's earnings report late Wednesday, investors who had placed wagers on Tesla shares falling had racked up about $10.5 billion in short interest -- making Tesla the most shorted stock in the U.S. on a dollar basis, according to financial-analytics firm S3 Partners.</p>
<p>Short sellers borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy back the shares at lower prices and then pocket the difference.</p>
<p>Those bets turned into a $1.7 billion loss Thursday after Tesla's results showed it burned through less cash than investors expected. Tesla shares jumped 16% to $349.54, part of a weekly gain that was Tesla's biggest since 2013 and one that wiped out all of short sellers' profits for the year. The shares fell $1.37 Friday.</p>
<p>Despite the whiplash, there were few signs of naysayers rushing to dump their positions. As of Thursday morning, Tesla remained the most heavily shorted stock in the U.S., attracting $4 billion more short interest than the second-most-shorted stock on the list, Apple Inc., according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.</p>
<p>After the rally at the end of trading Thursday, Tesla short interest had increased to about $12.6 billion, S3 Partners added.</p>
<p>For longtime Tesla skeptics, the reason was simple: Betting against Tesla has long been a volatile and money-losing trade, with the company's shares up more than 1,900% from its 2010 initial public offering price of $17. One post-earnings rally isn't enough to shake their conviction that the company, whose electric cars have upended the conventional automobile industry, is running through cash at an unsustainable pace.</p>
<p>"It's pounded my fund's performance over the last 18 months . . . but I don't let the stock price change how I feel about the company," said Mark Spiegel, who says his hedge fund, Stanphyl Capital, has been shorting Tesla for years and would continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Mr. Spiegel said he first began shorting Tesla around 2013, when its share price was trading in the high $90s. Once it got to around $200, "I thought, this is beyond ridiculous, and that's when I got a lot shorter," he said.</p>
<p>Wednesday's earnings report did little to impress Mr. Spiegel, who said he is troubled by competition from luxury auto makers that plan to roll out their own electric vehicles and issues with product delays, along with the pace at which the company has plowed through its cash.</p>
<p>Other investors with short positions in Tesla have cited skepticism over whether the company would be able to contend with challenges including product delays, layoffs and competition for the firm's Models S and X vehicles.</p>
<p>Hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc.'s short position in Tesla, whose shares jumped 29% last quarter, was its second-biggest loser throughout that period, according to a letter the firm's president, David Einhorn, distributed to investors this past week. Still, in his letter, Mr. Einhorn maintained that 2019 would likely be "a very challenging year" for Tesla.</p>
<p>Tesla shorts still face a long road to profitability after the latest rally. Investors who had bet on shares sliding are down $1.4 billion year to date, data from S3 Partners show.</p>
<p>Going back to 2016, Tesla shorts are down $6.4 billion, making it the third-worst-performing short over that time behind Nvidia and Amazon.com, according to S3 Partners.</p>
<p>Tesla isn't the only high-profile tech stock investors are betting against. The eight most-shorted U.S. stocks are all in the technology industry, with Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Netflix Inc. rounding out the list of the top five most-shorted U.S. companies, according to S3 Partners.</p>
<p>The bets reflect broad skepticism that technology companies, which have dominated the latest leg of the bull market, can continue meeting investors' lofty expectations. Disappointing results from Netflix sent the stock last month on its biggest one-day slide in years, while Facebook Inc. notched the worst-ever one-day loss in market cap for a publicly traded U.S. firm following its latest quarterly earnings report.</p>

Chief Executive Elon Musk jolted financial markets on Tuesday with a surprise proposal to take the electric-car maker private in what would be the biggest buyout in history.</p>
<p>About three hours into the trading day, Mr. Musk startled investors by writing on Twitter
 : "Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."</p>
<p>His message followed a report that a Saudi investment fund had taken a nearly 5% stake in Tesla.</p>
<p>The notion of a buyout, which would value Tesla above $70 billion, is itself extraordinary, as it would be far larger than any previous take-private deal. It immediately set off a guessing game of where Mr. Musk would get the funds.</p>
<p>The way Mr. Musk broke the news added to the drama, disclosing in a casually worded tweet the prospect of a buyout that would be an enormously complicated transaction for a company struggling to generate cash. It was a shocker even for investors who are often whipsawed by Mr. Musk's erratic comments on Twitter--he joked earlier this year about Tesla going bankrupt--and it intensified a battle between his supporters and a legion of bearish investors who have made Tesla the most heavily shorted stock.</p>
<p>While Mr. Musk continued tweeting about the possibility over the next few hours on Tuesday, Tesla's public-relations team and main Twitter account remained silent, adding to the intrigue. An hour before the market closed, while Tesla's stock was halted on Nasdaq, Tesla on its corporate site published a memo
  it said Mr. Musk sent to employees that confirmed his thinking.</p>
<p>The shares jumped when they resumed trading late in the day, gaining 11% to $379.57, or about 10.7% off the $420 threshold.</p>
<p>In the memo, Mr. Musk wrote that no final decision on a buyout has been made. He wrote that taking the company private would avoid the "wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla" and take away from short sellers "the incentive to attack" the company.</p>
<p>Tesla would create a special-purpose fund that would let existing investors keep their shares, Mr. Musk wrote. The unusual maneuver would let shareholders buy or sell shares every six months, he wrote, but it wasn't clear how such a fund would work or what the tax implications would be. Companies usually spell out the details of such proposed complex transactions in comprehensive, lawyered documents.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk owns about 20% of Tesla, with insiders owning another roughly 5% and individual investors holding about 12%. The remaining 62.2% is held by institutions.</p>
<p>"Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees," Mr. Musk wrote.</p>
<p>The memo and Mr. Musk's tweets left many questions unanswered. Most prominently, Mr. Musk didn't say who would pay for the buyout, leaving many observers skeptical he could pull off such a transaction.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund recently completed the purchase of a nearly 5% stake in Tesla, a senior Saudi adviser familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. He said he wasn't aware of any plan by the Saudi investment fund to increase its holding in Tesla. The Financial Times earlier reported news of the fund's stake.</p>
<p>Tesla lacks many of the characteristics of a typical leveraged buyout candidate, including a large, predictable stream of cash flow. Even though its sales are rising, Tesla still has been losing money and burning copious amounts of cash. The car maker also has regularly missed financial and production targets.
</p>
<p>In a typical LBO, the buyer contributes a relatively small amount of equity and uses debt to fund the remainder of the transaction. Even accounting for Mr. Musk's ownership stake, and any additional equity he could raise, such a deal would require tens of billions of dollars in bank borrowing, and it isn't clear who would provide it.</p>
<p>Tesla's market capitalization is about $60 billion. At $420, a buyout would cost about $72 billion--by far the largest LBO ever, according to Dealogic. It would eclipse the current record holder, Energy Future Holdings Corp., formerly TXU Corp., which was bought in 2007 for $32 billion. The Texas utility filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2014.</p>
<p>The surprise tweets on Tuesday came as Mr. Musk's long-combative stance against Tesla's short sellers has grown testier in recent months. He has repeatedly used Twitter to chide investors
  who are betting against his company, sometimes offering vague positive outlooks for the company that seemed to boost the stock, hurting short sellers' positions.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has been embattled for several months amid investor concern over whether the company's Fremont, Calif., factory can ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan.
  He told analysts last week that the pace of 5,000 sedans a week--a milestone Tesla reached
  toward the end of June--can be sustained, despite skepticism from some analysts.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has insisted that the increased pace of Model 3 output will allow the company to avoid the need to raise more capital. But many equity analysts aren't convinced.</p>
<p>In a research note Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he expects Tesla to raise equity of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, despite hiking his Model 3 production forecast by 50%, to about 50,000 cars in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has promised investors that Tesla, which went public in 2010, would start making a profit as of the third quarter. The company finished the second quarter with $2.2 billion of cash, and has said it needs a minimum cash balance of $1 billion.</p>
<p>Morningstar analyst David Whiston said the recent progress on Model 3 production "gives more credibility to the company" if Mr. Musk's plan is to secure funding for taking Tesla private.</p>
<p>Taking it private would allow the billionaire "to not constantly worry about going to the public markets for more money," Mr. Whiston said. "He can do what he needs to do behind closed doors and keep growing the company without all that extra scrutiny."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has informally floated the idea of a private Tesla before. In an interview with Rolling Stone published in November 2017, he said having to answer to public shareholders "makes us less efficient," and said "I wish we could be private with Tesla."</p>
<p>He has also toyed with taking his other company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., public. The rocket maker, where Mr. Musk is CEO, was last valued privately by investors at $21 billion. But Mr. Musk has nixed that idea more recently, people close to him have said, because the entrepreneur in him just couldn't stomach the idea of being held publicly accountable to shareholders.</p>

<p>That is what the Tesla Inc. chief executive said in announcing an audacious plan to take his $60-billion-plus auto maker private. But the company has given no details of how such a buyout would work, or if funding is indeed in place.</p>
<p>If Tesla doesn't move ahead with a deal, or if the funding isn't set, regulators could probe whether Mr. Musk made a false statement that caused the price of his company's stock to skyrocket about 11%.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk made the disclosure on his Twitter account, where he has over 22 million followers and has lashed out at short sellers, reporters and other critics of his company. Mr. Musk even joked earlier this year on Twitter about Tesla going into bankruptcy, at a time when his company's cash position was under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk released an email he sent to Tesla workers offering more details, which said a buyout would be subject to a shareholder vote. But he didn't offer proof to back up his claim that he has money to take the company private at $420 a share. If he doesn't, his statement "could be seen as manipulation" of Tesla's share price, said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University. "That's a factual statement, and if it's material, that's the kind of lawsuit plaintiffs' lawyers regard as Christmas in August," Mr. Coffee said.</p>
<p>Regulators, who unlike private plaintiffs can subpoena information before filing a lawsuit, could examine the facts behind Mr. Musk's statement if Tesla doesn't follow through with regulatory filings that explain the terms of the deal. The Securities and Exchange Commission can file fraud charges against companies and corporate officers it believes to have made misleading or false statements.</p>
<p>"If there is a real filing and a press release that comes out in the next week, then you have something to evaluate the tweet against," said Michael Liftik, a former SEC enforcement attorney now at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan LLP. "You'd want to sit back and see how events play out."</p>
<p>The SEC generally allows companies to disseminate news using social media as long as they have told shareholders they might use those channels in addition to regulatory filings.</p>
<p>Tesla told investors in a November 2013 filing to follow Mr. Musk's Twitter feed for "additional information" about the company.</p>
<p>The SEC announced its position in 2013 when it explained why it wouldn't try to punish Netflix Inc. or its CEO Reed Hastings over his disclosure of sensitive information about his streaming service's viewership on his own Facebook page.</p>
<p>An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk, who owns a Tesla stake of roughly 20%, can't consummate such a buyout all by himself. If it goes forward, an independent committee of Tesla's board will have to evaluate the deal, using its own lawyers and investment bankers, to determine whether the transaction and the price are in the company's best interest, Mr. Coffee said.</p>
<p>"Only the board can agree to do this," he said. "The board is going to have to decide what they think is the true fair value of the company."</p>
<p>One other factor that may come into play, Mr. Coffee said, is that Tesla is incorporated in Delaware. That suggests Tesla would want to get a majority of the shares not owned by Mr. Musk to support a going-private deal, to win a more-favorable standard for review of the deal under Delaware law.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's war with short-sellers--investors who are betting Tesla's stock price will decline--gives him a motive to want to boost the price. If the deal ultimately isn't pursued, Mr. Coffee said, "one possible interpretation" of Mr. Musk's disclosure is "spiteful revenge on short-sellers."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk, in his email to employees, cited short-sellers and other pressures public markets put on companies as factors in announcing he wanted to take the company private.</p>
<p>"Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term," Mr. Musk said. Being public "means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company."</p>

<p>The electric-car company's chief said in one tweet
  that as part of the deal he envisions, Tesla's current investors could either sell or keep their stakes. He said he would create a "special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla," likening the prospect to an arrangement he said his Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has with Fidelity Investments.</p>
<p>It isn't clear what Mr. Musk meant by that reference or how a special-purpose vehicle might be employed in a buyout of Tesla. Fidelity's flagship mutual fund has invested in closely held SpaceX, but no special-purpose vehicle was involved, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>A special-purpose vehicle that is accessible to all shareholders would be unprecedented, lawyers said. Tesla would effectively be creating a new public company and would need to file a registration statement with regulators.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk may instead be envisioning the creation of a fund comprised of a select group of institutional investors that would help him finance a buyout, lawyers said. Investing in such a vehicle might be attractive to those who believe Tesla is worth more than $420 a share.</p>
<p>Tesla shares closed Tuesday at $379.57, up 11%.</p>
<p>While there are precedents for founders, executives and other big investors rolling their stakes into leveraged buyouts, rarely if ever do individual investors have the opportunity do so. Just over 12% of Tesla's investors are individuals and others, according to FactSet, while insiders including Mr. Musk own just over 25%.</p>
<p>The remaining 62.2% of shares are held by institutions led by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity and Baillie Gifford &amp; Co.</p>
<p>What's more, when big, anchor investors try to take companies private, they often face opposition from other shareholders. That was the case when Michael Dell--ultimately successfully--sought to take his namesake computer maker private in 2013. More recently, a special committee of the board of Nordstrom Inc. called off discussions with members of the high-end department store chain's founding family about taking it private after the two sides failed to agree on price.</p>
<p>Potentially working in Mr. Musk's favor, private-funding sources have expanded in recent years, enabling many Silicon Valley startups to avoid the glare of public ownership. In a follow-up blog post. Mr. Musk bemoaned "wild swings" in the company's share price as well as quarterly earnings demands and heavy short selling. He indicated that as a private company, Tesla's external shareholders and employees would be able to buy and sell their stock about every six months.</p>
<p>If Mr. Musk takes Tesla private, investors who sell their shares for cash would owe tax on any proceeds, according to Robert Willens, an independent tax analyst. The shares sold will generate long- or short-term capital gains or losses for shareholders.The current top rate on long-term capital gains is 23.8%, including a tax on net investment income.</p>
<p>For example, if a shareholder receives $420 in cash for a Tesla share purchased at $160, the taxable long-term capital gain would be $260 a share. But if an investor receives a mixture of cash and equity, then the cash portion would be taxable.</p>
<p>If an investor in Tesla swaps current shares for those in a special-purpose fund, the exchange would be tax-free, according to Mr. Willens.</p>

Chief Executive Elon Musk jolted financial markets on Tuesday with a surprise proposal to take the electric-car maker private in what would be the biggest buyout in history.</p>
<p>About three hours into the trading day, Mr. Musk startled investors by writing on Twitter: "Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."</p>
<p>His message followed a report that a Saudi investment fund had taken a nearly 5% stake in Tesla.</p>
<p>The notion of a buyout, which would value Tesla above $70 billion, is itself extraordinary, as it would be far larger than any previous take-private deal. It immediately set off a guessing game of where Mr. Musk would get the funds.</p>
<p>The way Mr. Musk broke the news added to the drama, disclosing in a casually worded tweet the prospect of a buyout that would be an enormously complicated transaction for a company struggling to generate cash. It was a shocker even for investors who are often whipsawed by Mr. Musk's erratic comments on Twitter -- he joked earlier this year about Tesla going bankrupt -- and it intensified a battle between his supporters and a legion of bearish investors who have made Tesla the most heavily shorted stock.</p>
<p>While Mr. Musk continued tweeting about the possibility over the next few hours on Tuesday, Tesla's public-relations team and main Twitter account remained silent, adding to the intrigue. An hour before the market closed, while Tesla's stock was halted on Nasdaq, Tesla on its corporate site published a memo it said Mr. Musk sent to employees that confirmed his thinking.</p>
<p>The shares jumped when they resumed trading late in the day, gaining 11% to $379.57, or about 10.7% off the $420 threshold.</p>
<p>In the memo, Mr. Musk wrote that no final decision on a buyout has been made. He wrote that taking the company private would avoid the "wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla" and take away from short sellers "the incentive to attack" the company.</p>
<p>Tesla would create a special-purpose fund that would let existing investors keep their shares, Mr. Musk wrote. The unusual maneuver would let shareholders buy or sell shares every six months, he wrote, but it wasn't clear how such a fund would work or what the tax implications would be. Companies usually spell out the details of such proposed complex transactions in comprehensive, lawyered documents.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk owns about 20% of Tesla, with insiders owning another roughly 5% and individual investors holding about 12%. The remaining 62.2% is held by institutions.</p>
<p>"Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees," Mr. Musk wrote.</p>
<p>The memo and Mr. Musk's tweets left many questions unanswered. Most prominently, Mr. Musk didn't say who would pay for the buyout, leaving many observers skeptical he could pull off such a transaction.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund recently completed the purchase of a nearly 5% stake in Tesla, a senior Saudi adviser familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. He said he wasn't aware of any plan by the Saudi investment fund to increase its holding in Tesla. The Financial Times earlier reported news of the fund's stake.</p>
<p>Tesla lacks many of the characteristics of a typical leveraged buyout candidate, including a large, predictable stream of cash flow. Even though its sales are rising, Tesla still has been losing money and burning copious amounts of cash. The car maker also has regularly missed financial and production targets.</p>
<p>In a typical LBO, the buyer contributes a relatively small amount of equity and uses debt to fund the remainder of the transaction. Even accounting for Mr. Musk's ownership stake, and any additional equity he could raise, such a deal would require tens of billions of dollars in bank borrowing, and it isn't clear who would provide it.</p>
<p>Tesla's market capitalization is about $60 billion. At $420, a buyout would cost about $72 billion -- by far the largest LBO ever, according to Dealogic. It would eclipse the current record holder, Energy Future Holdings Corp., formerly TXU Corp., which was bought in 2007 for $32 billion. The Texas utility filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2014.</p>
<p>The surprise tweets on Tuesday came as Mr. Musk's long-combative stance against Tesla's short sellers has grown testier in recent months. He has repeatedly used Twitter to chide investors who are betting against his company, sometimes offering vague positive outlooks for the company that seemed to boost the stock, hurting short sellers' positions.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has been embattled for several months amid investor concern over whether the company's Fremont, Calif., factory can ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan. He told analysts last week that the pace of 5,000 sedans a week -- a milestone Tesla reached toward the end of June -- can be sustained, despite skepticism from some analysts.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has insisted that the increased pace of Model 3 output will allow the company to avoid the need to raise more capital. But many equity analysts aren't convinced.</p>
<p>In a research note Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he expects Tesla to raise equity of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, despite hiking his Model 3 production forecast by 50%, to about 50,000 cars in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has promised investors that Tesla, which went public in 2010, would start making a profit as of the third quarter. The company finished the second quarter with $2.2 billion of cash, and has said it needs a minimum cash balance of $1 billion.</p>
<p>Morningstar analyst David Whiston said the recent progress on Model 3 production "gives more credibility to the company" if Mr. Musk's plan is to secure funding for taking Tesla private.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has informally floated the idea of a private Tesla before. In an interview with Rolling Stone published in November 2017, he said having to answer to public shareholders "makes us less efficient," and said "I wish we could be private with Tesla."</p>
<p>He has also toyed with taking his other company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., public. The rocket maker, where Mr. Musk is CEO, was last valued privately by investors at $21 billion. But Mr. Musk has nixed that idea more recently, people close to him have said, because the entrepreneur in him just couldn't stomach the idea of being held publicly accountable to shareholders.</p>

<p>Two Little Words</p>
<p>Raise Big Questions</p>
<p>Two words on Twitter may haunt Elon Musk: "Funding secured." That is what the Tesla Inc. chief executive said in announcing an audacious plan to take his $60 billion-plus auto maker private. But the company has given no details of how such a buyout would work, or if funding is indeed in place.</p>
<p>If Tesla doesn't move ahead with a deal, or if the funding isn't set, regulators could probe whether Mr. Musk made a false statement that caused the price of his company's stock to soar about 11%.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk didn't offer proof to back up his claim that he has money to take the company private at $420 a share. If he doesn't, his statement "could be seen as manipulation" of Tesla's share price, said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Regulators, who unlike private plaintiffs can subpoena information before filing a lawsuit, could examine the facts behind Mr. Musk's statement if Tesla doesn't follow through with regulatory filings that explain the terms of the deal. The Securities and Exchange Commission can file fraud charges against companies and corporate officers it believes to have made misleading or false statements. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>

  in what would be the biggest buyout in history.</p>
<p>"Last week, Elon opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private," according to a statement from several board members. The talks included how being a private company could "better serve Tesla's long-term interests, and also addressed the funding for this to occur," said the statement from independent directors Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice, and James Murdoch.</p>
<p>The board has nine members, of which seven are independent. The statement wasn't signed by Mr. Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk or the seventh independent director Steve Jurvetson, who is currently on leave.</p>
<p>Musk jolted financial markets on Tuesday with his surprise proposal to take the Palo Alto, Calif., company private.</p>
<p>About three hours into the trading day, Mr. Musk startled investors by writing on Twitter:
  "Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."</p>
<p>His message followed a report that a Saudi investment fund had taken a nearly 5% stake in Tesla.</p>
<p>In subsequent tweets, Mr. Musk said that going private would end "negative propaganda" from short sellers.</p>
<p>The notion of a buyout, which would value Tesla above $70 billion, is itself extraordinary, as it would be far larger than any previous take-private deal.</p>
<p>Shares of Tesla, up 1.6% in the past year, fell nearly 1% in early trading Wednesday.</p>

Chief Executive Elon Musk jolted financial markets on Tuesday with a surprise proposal to take the electric-car maker private in what would be the biggest buyout in history.</p>
<p>About three hours into the trading day, Mr. Musk startled investors by writing on Twitter
 : "Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."</p>
<p>His message followed a report that a Saudi investment fund had taken a nearly 5% stake in Tesla.</p>
<p>The notion of a buyout, which would value Tesla above $70 billion, is itself extraordinary, as it would be far larger than any previous take-private deal. It immediately set off a guessing game of where Mr. Musk would get the funds.</p>
<p>The way Mr. Musk broke the news added to the drama, disclosing in a casually worded tweet the prospect of a buyout that would be an enormously complicated transaction for a company struggling to generate cash. It was a shocker even for investors who are often whipsawed by Mr. Musk's erratic comments on Twitter--he joked earlier this year about Tesla going bankrupt--and it intensified a battle between his supporters and a legion of bearish investors who have made Tesla the most heavily shorted stock.</p>
<p>While Mr. Musk continued tweeting about the possibility over the next few hours on Tuesday, Tesla's public-relations team and main Twitter account remained silent, adding to the intrigue. An hour before the market closed, while Tesla's stock was halted on Nasdaq, Tesla on its corporate site published a memo
  it said Mr. Musk sent to employees that confirmed his thinking.</p>
<p>The shares jumped when they resumed trading late in the day, gaining 11% to $379.57, or about 10.7% off the $420 threshold.</p>
<p>In the memo, Mr. Musk wrote that no final decision on a buyout has been made. He wrote that taking the company private would avoid the "wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla" and take away from short sellers "the incentive to attack" the company.</p>
<p>Tesla would create a special-purpose fund that would let existing investors keep their shares, Mr. Musk wrote. The unusual maneuver would let shareholders buy or sell shares every six months, he wrote, but it wasn't clear how such a fund would work or what the tax implications would be. Companies usually spell out the details of such proposed complex transactions in comprehensive, lawyered documents.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk owns about 20% of Tesla, with insiders owning another roughly 5% and individual investors holding about 12%. The remaining 62.2% is held by institutions.</p>
<p>"Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees," Mr. Musk wrote.</p>
<p>The memo and Mr. Musk's tweets left many questions unanswered. Most prominently, Mr. Musk didn't say who would pay for the buyout, leaving many observers skeptical he could pull off such a transaction.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund recently completed the purchase of a nearly 5% stake in Tesla, a senior Saudi adviser familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. He said he wasn't aware of any plan by the Saudi investment fund to increase its holding in Tesla. The Financial Times earlier reported news of the fund's stake.</p>
<p>Tesla lacks many of the characteristics of a typical leveraged buyout candidate, including a large, predictable stream of cash flow. Even though its sales are rising, Tesla still has been losing money and burning copious amounts of cash. The car maker also has regularly missed financial and production targets.
</p>
<p>In a typical LBO, the buyer contributes a relatively small amount of equity and uses debt to fund the remainder of the transaction. Even accounting for Mr. Musk's ownership stake, and any additional equity he could raise, such a deal would require tens of billions of dollars in bank borrowing, and it isn't clear who would provide it.</p>
<p>Tesla's market capitalization is about $60 billion. At $420, a buyout would cost about $72 billion--by far the largest LBO ever, according to Dealogic. It would eclipse the current record holder, Energy Future Holdings Corp., formerly TXU Corp., which was bought in 2007 for $32 billion. The Texas utility filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2014.</p>
<p>The surprise tweets on Tuesday came as Mr. Musk's long-combative stance against Tesla's short sellers has grown testier in recent months. He has repeatedly used Twitter to chide investors
  who are betting against his company, sometimes offering vague positive outlooks for the company that seemed to boost the stock, hurting short sellers' positions.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has been embattled for several months amid investor concern over whether the company's Fremont, Calif., factory can ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan.
  He told analysts last week that the pace of 5,000 sedans a week--a milestone Tesla reached
  toward the end of June--can be sustained, despite skepticism from some analysts.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has insisted that the increased pace of Model 3 output will allow the company to avoid the need to raise more capital. But many equity analysts aren't convinced.</p>
<p>In a research note Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he expects Tesla to raise equity of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, despite hiking his Model 3 production forecast by 50%, to about 50,000 cars in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has promised investors that Tesla, which went public in 2010, would start making a profit as of the third quarter. The company finished the second quarter with $2.2 billion of cash, and has said it needs a minimum cash balance of $1 billion.</p>
<p>Morningstar analyst David Whiston said the recent progress on Model 3 production "gives more credibility to the company" if Mr. Musk's plan is to secure funding for taking Tesla private.</p>
<p>Taking it private would allow the billionaire "to not constantly worry about going to the public markets for more money," Mr. Whiston said. "He can do what he needs to do behind closed doors and keep growing the company without all that extra scrutiny."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has informally floated the idea of a private Tesla before. In an interview with Rolling Stone published in November 2017, he said having to answer to public shareholders "makes us less efficient," and said "I wish we could be private with Tesla."</p>
<p>He has also toyed with taking his other company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., public. The rocket maker, where Mr. Musk is CEO, was last valued privately by investors at $21 billion. But Mr. Musk has nixed that idea more recently, people close to him have said, because the entrepreneur in him just couldn't stomach the idea of being held publicly accountable to shareholders.</p>

There are companies that should go private, and there are companies that shouldn't.</p>
<p>Generic drugmaker Mylan N.V. is on the right side of those questions. Tesla Inc. is on the wrong side.</p>
<p>Mylan on Wednesday said it was considering a strategic review
 . The board said that "public markets continue to underappreciate and undervalue the durability, differentiation and strengths of Mylan's global diversified business."</p>
<p>Contrast that with Tuesday's tweet by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who said that not only was the electric-car company considering going private, but that funding for the $70 billion deal was already secured. Tesla's board only weighed in a day later, saying it was talking about a buyout
  and "also addressed the funding for this to occur."</p>
<p>True, Mr. Musk isn't a typical CEO, but neither is Mylan's feisty chief executive, Heather Bresch. Mylan has had its own share of drama. Its shares sold off 3% Wednesday morning after Mylan reported weak second-quarter results. Sales in North America fell 22% from a year ago, as a weak environment for pricing continues to hamper the generic-drug industry. Although the stock finished Wednesday up nearly 2%, it is down more than 50% from its 2015 high, when Ms. Bresch was vigorously fighting a takeover offer from rival Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.</p>
<p>Of course, buyouts succeed or fail based on company fundamentals, not CEO bravado. Mylan can't boast Tesla's growth prospects, but it has a portfolio of strong, established products. More important, it has a strong balance sheet with an investment-grade credit rating and generated more than $1 billion in operating cash flow in the first half of the year, according to generally accepted accounting principles. Tesla's operating cash flow over that same period was negative $528 million.</p>
<p>Mylan's market value is about $20 billion and trades at about eight times its newly lowered earnings forecast. Tesla is valued at $65 billion (making Mr. Musk's claim that public markets are treating Tesla poorly seem dubious) and, given its persistent losses, doesn't have a price/earnings ratio.</p>
<p>Investors have both companies wrong. They should sell Tesla after Tuesday's 11% pop and buy Mylan after Wednesday's selloff. Hype may sell cars, but it usually doesn't make money for investors.</p>

But going private could also complicate Tesla's effort to build a mainstream electric car by removing the easy access to capital the Wall Street darling has enjoyed.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk on Tuesday proposed taking Tesla private
  at $420 a share, about 11% higher than the day's closing stock price. He called the funding "secured" for what would be the biggest-ever corporate buyout, but he hasn't disclosed details. The board on Wednesday said it is still evaluating the plan.
  Tesla's stock was down 2% to $371.35 in Wednesday afternoon trading.</p>
<p>Taking Tesla private would end one of the fiercest debates in recent years between bulls and bears, with Mr. Musk frequently sparring
  with detractors and short sellers. It would also shield Tesla's financial health and other competitive information from rivals racing to catch up with their own electric vehicles.</p>
<p>In a memo to employees and several Twitter messages Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he believes a private capital structure will allow Tesla to tap its full potential. "We are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission," he wrote in the memo.</p>
<p>Still, analysts say a key to Tesla's success has been its ability to use the high profile and promotional skills of its CEO and the loyal investor support it engenders to easily raise fresh equity. Since it went public in 2010, Tesla has raised nearly $4 billion from public stock offerings to help fund operating losses, in addition to more than $13 billion from the debt markets.</p>
<p>"Tesla has hugely benefited from supportive public markets and from abnormally low cost of capital, which may not be sustained privately," Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a research note.</p>
<p>The billionaire CEO has never fit the mold of public-company CEO. He often has shrugged off badly missed financial forecasts or production targets and has jousted with analysts and short sellers. The pressure mounted in the past year as Mr. Musk twice missed self-imposed production deadlines,
  even as he sometimes slept on the factory floor to meet them.</p>
<p>Leading a private company could allow Mr. Musk greater latitude to run Tesla the way he wants, analysts say, pulling off his unorthodox moves without the penalty of an immediate stock hit. Tesla's shares tanked in 2016 when he merged Tesla
  with solar-panel company SolarCity Corp., of which Mr. Musk was the largest shareholder. Some investors viewed the deal as a bailout of a firm that had struggled to raise capital.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk said in Tuesday's memo that he has no plans to combine Tesla with his other company, rocket maker Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</p>
<p>"He seems to be most excited and operating at his best when he's afforded the opportunity to simply focus on the company," Jamie Albertine, an analyst with Consumer Edge Research, said.</p>
<p>For automotive competitors, the move would reduce visibility into a company that has captured the collective attention of a once-skeptical industry.</p>
<p>Tesla initially was dismissed by auto executives from Detroit to Germany as a dreamy upstart dabbling in an electric-car market in which consumers had little interest. But Tesla soon developed a fervent fan base and drew luxury-car buyers eager to pay $100,000 for Tesla's Model S sedan and later the Model X sport-utility vehicle.</p>
<p>Despite persistent losses and production struggles, investors rewarded Tesla, which became a bellwether for where Wall Street was placing its automotive bets. Tesla's market value
  of about $64 billion is higher than that of General Motors Co., and nearly equal to Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV combined.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's go-private plan ultimately could again pressure traditional auto makers, says Evercore ISI analyst George Galliers. He sees a scenario whereby Tesla is successful lining up strategic investors to not only take the company private but commit ongoing capital for its international expansion.</p>
<p>"This only increases the need for transition" at traditional car companies, who must manage an overhaul of their product offerings to electric from gasoline-powered "if they choose to compete with a potentially faster and more nimble Tesla," Mr. Galliers wrote in a note.</p>
<p>Even as a private company, pressure will remain on Tesla to lift production so it can boost free cash flow to pay down its roughly $10 billion in debt
  and fund planned expansions. Mr. Musk has repeatedly missed production milestones for the Model 3 sedan, the car introduced last year that is intended to transform Tesla into a profitable, self-sustaining company.</p>
<p>Tesla also needs to sell more cars to fund considerable capital expenditures. The company plans
  to build a factory in China in coming years and has also explored
  building one in Europe. It is also developing a small SUV, a booming category.</p>
<p>Any traditionally-structured buyout deal for the car maker could leave it in a more precarious financial position than it already finds itself. Barclays analyst Brian Johnson estimates Tesla would need to pay $2.7 billion annually in potential interest if it were to raise $40 billion in debt to fund a deal. It had just $2.2 billion in the bank at the end of the second quarter, and has $2 billion in debt coming due in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Going private could also crimp a key recruiting tool: stock options. Mr. Musk is proposing that Tesla create a special-purpose fund for existing shareholders to retain their stakes if they want. They could sell or buy every six months, but shares would be less liquid.</p>

<p>Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission want to know whether Mr. Musk had a factual basis for tweeting Tuesday that the going-private transaction
  was all but certain, with only a shareholder vote needed to pull it off, the people said.</p>
<p>The SEC's inquiries
 , which originated from the agency's San Francisco office, suggest Tesla could come under an enforcement investigation if regulators suspect that Mr. Musk's statement was misleading or false.</p>
<p>It couldn't be learned on Wednesday whether the agency had opened a formal enforcement investigation. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, companies and corporate officers can't give shareholders misleading information about meaningful company events. Mr. Musk also could be in trouble if regulators develop evidence that he made a statement aimed at goosing his company's share price.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk shocked Wall Street by tweeting Tuesday
  that he planned to take the electric-car maker private at $420 a share, or $72 billion. That is about 20% above the stock's trading price earlier that day and 11% higher than its Tuesday closing price. In his tweet Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Musk wrote that the buyout had "funding secured," but he didn't provide any details.</p>
<p>Thomas Farley, a former president of the New York Stock Exchange, said it would be relatively straightforward for regulators to fact-check some of Mr. Musk's statements. Mr. Farley said regulators could ask to see any legal agreements that Tesla has with financial partners or backers on the going-private deal.</p>
<p>"If funding is certain, there is documentation to demonstrate that," Mr. Farley said. "This is a very easy one to manage, and they should manage it."</p>
<p>The probe by the SEC adds to a swirl of news around the electric-car maker this week. A group of Tesla board members
  said Wednesday Mr. Musk spoke to them last week about taking the company private.</p>
<p>"Last week, Elon opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private," the statement from several board members said. The talks included how being a private company could "better serve Tesla's long-term interests, and also addressed the funding for this to occur," independent directors Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice and James Murdoch said in the statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, is the son of Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of Fox and News Corp, publisher of The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The board has nine members, of which seven are independent. The statement wasn't signed by Mr. Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk or the remaining independent director, Steve Jurvetson, who is currently on leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk and Tesla haven't provided many more details of the potential deal since Mr. Musk's tweets Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The SEC generally allows companies to disseminate news using social media as long as they have told shareholders they might use those channels in addition to regulatory filings. Tesla told investors in a November 2013 filing to follow Mr. Musk's Twitter feed for "additional information" about the company.</p>
<p>The company filed its regular quarterly report with the SEC Monday evening, days after the board discussions had begun, but it said nothing in the report about a potential buyout.</p>
<p>Tesla wouldn't be required to tell the public more until something is completed, said Jill Fisch, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. If it did, it might say something that later turns out to be incorrect and has to be retracted. Still, she said, "I think ensuring a level playing field in the way in which information reaches the investing public is very important."</p>
<p>At the very least, Mr. Musk's announcement served Tesla's purposes by boosting its share price. If it remains elevated, that could help the company hold on to much-needed cash, by giving it more flexibility in dealing with convertible bonds coming due soon.</p>
<p>Tesla has $920 million in convertible bonds that come due in March, with a conversion price of $359.87. If Tesla stock is below that level at the time, the company will have to spend cash to redeem the bonds; if the stock price is above that level, the convertible holders will convert them into Tesla shares, relieving the company of the need to lay out cash.</p>
<p>Tesla had $2.2 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of June 30 and free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion in the first half of 2018.</p>
<p>Tuesday's spike took Tesla stock above the trigger price, and the shares remained above it Wednesday, though they slipped 2.4% to close at $370.34.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has been at war with short sellers--investors who are betting Tesla's stock price will decline--and has used Twitter before to joust with them.</p>
<p>In an email to employees on Tuesday, Mr. Musk cited short sellers and other pressures public markets put on companies as factors in announcing he wanted to take the company private. In subsequent tweets, Mr. Musk wrote that going private would end "negative propaganda" from short sellers.</p>
<p>"That will be the question that comes out: What was the reason for the disclosure?" said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</p>

<p>Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission want to know whether Mr. Musk had a factual basis for tweeting Tuesday that the going-private transaction was all but certain, with only a shareholder vote needed to pull it off, the people said.</p>
<p>The SEC's inquiries, which originated from the agency's San Francisco office, suggest Tesla could come under an enforcement investigation if regulators suspect that Mr. Musk's statement was misleading or false.</p>
<p>It couldn't be learned on Wednesday whether the agency had opened a formal enforcement investigation. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, companies and corporate officers can't give shareholders misleading information about meaningful company events. Mr. Musk also could be in trouble if regulators develop evidence that he made a statement aimed at goosing his company's share price.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk shocked Wall Street by tweeting Tuesday that he planned to take the electric-car maker private at $420 a share, or $72 billion. That is about 20% above the stock's trading price earlier that day and 11% higher than its Tuesday closing price. In his tweet Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Musk wrote that the buyout had "funding secured," but he didn't provide any details.</p>
<p>Thomas Farley, a former president of the New York Stock Exchange, said it would be relatively straightforward for regulators to fact-check some of Mr. Musk's statements. Mr. Farley said regulators could ask to see any legal agreements that Tesla has with financial partners or backers on the going-private deal.</p>
<p>"If funding is certain, there is documentation to demonstrate that," Mr. Farley said. "This is a very easy one to manage, and they should manage it."</p>
<p>The probe by the SEC adds to a swirl of news around the electric-car maker this week. A group of Tesla board members said Wednesday Mr. Musk spoke to them last week about taking the company private.</p>
<p>"Last week, Elon opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private," the statement from several board members said. The talks included how being a private company could "better serve Tesla's long-term interests, and also addressed the funding for this to occur," independent directors Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice and James Murdoch said in the statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, is the son of Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of Fox and News Corp, publisher of The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The board has nine members, of which seven are independent. The statement wasn't signed by Mr. Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk or the remaining independent director, Steve Jurvetson, who is currently on leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk and Tesla haven't provided many more details of the potential deal since Mr. Musk's tweets Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The SEC generally allows companies to disseminate news using social media as long as they have told shareholders they might use those channels in addition to regulatory filings. Tesla told investors in a November 2013 filing to follow Mr. Musk's Twitter feed for "additional information" about the company.</p>
<p>The company filed its regular quarterly report with the SEC Monday evening, days after the board discussions had begun, but it said nothing in the report about a potential buyout.</p>
<p>Tesla wouldn't be required to tell the public more until something is completed, said Jill Fisch, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. If it did, it might say something that later turns out to be incorrect and has to be retracted. Still, she said, "I think ensuring a level playing field in the way in which information reaches the investing public is very important."</p>
<p>At the very least, Mr. Musk's announcement served Tesla's purposes by boosting its share price. If it remains elevated, that could help the company hold on to much-needed cash, by giving it more flexibility in dealing with convertible bonds coming due soon.</p>
<p>Tesla has $920 million in convertible bonds that come due in March, with a conversion price of $359.87. If Tesla stock is below that level at the time, the company will have to spend cash to redeem the bonds; if the stock price is above that level, the convertible holders will convert them into Tesla shares, relieving the company of the need to lay out cash.</p>
<p>Tesla had $2.2 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of June 30 and free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion in the first half of 2018.</p>
<p>Tuesday's spike took Tesla stock above the trigger price, and the shares remained above it Wednesday, though they slipped 2.4% to close at $370.34.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has been at war with short sellers -- investors who are betting Tesla's stock price will decline -- and has used Twitter before to joust with them.</p>
<p>In an email to employees on Tuesday, Mr. Musk cited short sellers and other pressures public markets put on companies as factors in announcing he wanted to take the company private. In subsequent tweets, Mr. Musk wrote that going private would end "negative propaganda" from short sellers.</p>
<p>"That will be the question that comes out: What was the reason for the disclosure?" said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</p>

But going private could also complicate Tesla's effort to build a mainstream electric car by removing the easy access to capital the Wall Street darling has enjoyed.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk on Tuesday proposed taking Tesla private at $420 a share, about 11% higher than the day's closing stock price. He called the funding "secured" for what would be the biggest corporate buyout to date, but he hasn't disclosed details. The board on Wednesday said it is still evaluating the plan. Tesla's stock closed down 2.4% at $370.34 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Taking Tesla private would end one of the fiercest debates in recent years between bulls and bears, with Mr. Musk frequently sparring with detractors and short sellers. It would also shield Tesla's financial health and other competitive information from rivals racing to catch up with their own electric vehicles.</p>
<p>In a memo to employees and several Twitter messages Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he believes a private capital structure would allow Tesla to tap its full potential.</p>
<p>"We are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission," he wrote in the memo.</p>
<p>Still, analysts say a key to Tesla's success has been its ability to use the high profile and promotional skills of its chief executive and the loyal investor support it engenders to easily raise fresh equity. Since it went public in 2010, Tesla has raised nearly $4 billion from public stock offerings to help fund operating losses, in addition to over $13 billion from the debt markets.</p>
<p>"Tesla has hugely benefited from supportive public markets and from abnormally low cost of capital, which may not be sustained privately," Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a research note.</p>
<p>The billionaire CEO has never fit the mold of a public-company CEO. He often has shrugged off badly missed financial forecasts or production targets and has jousted with analysts and short sellers. The pressure mounted in the past year as Mr. Musk twice missed self-imposed production deadlines, even as he sometimes slept on the factory floor to meet them.</p>
<p>Leading a private company could allow Mr. Musk greater latitude to run Tesla the way he wants, analysts say, pulling off his unorthodox moves without the penalty of an immediate stock hit. Tesla's shares tanked in 2016 when he merged Tesla with solar-panel company SolarCity Corp., of which Mr. Musk was the largest shareholder. Some investors viewed the deal as a bailout of a company that had struggled to raise capital.</p>

His latest piece of showmanship--an offer to take electric-car maker
  Tesla Inc. private--amounts to a slap in the face for shareholders. Worse, Mr. Musk's reasoning for abandoning Tesla's listing is flawed at almost every level. The saving grace is that if the deal goes ahead, shareholders can bail out by accepting Mr. Musk's offer at a premium of 23% above Monday's undisturbed price.</p>
<p>The basic argument is increasingly deployed by frustrated executives and self-promoting private-equity groups: Companies are doing dumb things to meet the market's quarterly expectations, and hurting their long-term prospects as a result. Take the company private and executives no longer have to care about the short term, allowing them to invest for the long run and help the company, their loyal shareholders and wider society.</p>
<p>The trouble is that none of this applies to Tesla.</p>
<p>It is hard to think of a company that cares less about sucking up to Wall Street than Tesla. Mr. Musk earlier this year rejected "boring bonehead questions" from analysts
  on his quarterly earnings call; the company offers no guidance on quarterly earnings; and it has frequently and unapologetically reported losses far worse than expected (only twice has it made a quarterly profit, both times a surprise).</p>
<p>Tesla is also part of a select group of listed companies whose shareholders are strongly supportive of long-term investment. Tesla shares have jumped
  from an initial public offering price of $17 in 2010 to $370 on Wednesday, even as Mr. Musk invested or lost billions of dollars of the company's money, repeatedly sold new stock and diluted investors by paying staff partly in shares. Short-term thinking isn't compatible with being a Tesla stockholder. Indeed, it is hard to imagine many private-equity or venture-capital groups would have stuck with Tesla for eight years as it burned through so much cash.</p>
<p>Short-termist pressure on management can come through three routes: board members worried about the share price, proxy votes by activists or unwanted bids. Yet, the board appears to be entirely made up of Musk fans, to such an extent that they called him only "Elon" in a statement on Wednesday confirming the take-private proposal. Activists have paid no attention to Tesla, partly because its shareholders are so supportive but also because any switch in strategy would involve ejecting Mr. Musk and surely crush the stock. The idea of a hostile bid for Tesla is fantastical, too: Its market value of $65 billion is higher than Ford Motor Co. or BMW AG. In short, the only constraint Mr. Musk faces is finding enough cash to keep the business going, and the supposedly short-termist markets have been falling over themselves to help out.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk makes three other claims in his email to staff about the take-private idea, one misleading, one unlikely and one downright daft.</p>
<p>The misleading suggestion is that what he calls "wild swings" in the stock price distract staff, who are shareholders. Going private would change this only by hiding the volatility: Instead of being able to buy or sell every day, they could do so only twice a year. The true value of the company would still swing around wildly, but no one would know. Perhaps the Tesla production line is so far behind schedule because workers spend their time day-trading the stock and gossiping about the latest price moves, in which case going private would solve the problem. But it is hard to believe.</p>
<p>The unlikely idea is that short sellers are damaging the business. Mr. Musk said Tesla is the most-shorted company in history, and everyone betting on a share price fall has an incentive to attack it.</p>
<p>Short sellers spreading false rumors or actively trying to find and publicize problems with the cars could in principle damage the business. But Tesla's big problems haven't been secret, with highly public manufacturing difficulties, poor production quality and a constant need for new cash. Mr. Musk hasn't helped, either, posting an April fools joke on Twitter that the company was bankrupt
 .</p>
<p>The daft idea was his suggestion that Tesla go private with the same shareholders as today. Right now, shareholders can sell whenever they want and, to Mr. Musk's chagrin, lend shares to short sellers for a fee. Restricting the option to sell to twice a year might be good for Mr. Musk's war on shorts, but it should make the stock much less appealing to current shareholders. Selling in Mr. Musk's offer looks more attractive still.</p>
<p>There is one possible reason for going private that might make sense, but that Mr. Musk can't mention. The private markets are awash in cash, allowing startups such as Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb Inc. and Mr. Musk's own SpaceX to stay private far longer than in the past by raising large amounts of money at high valuations.</p>
<p>Tesla isn't the right sort of company to appeal to ordinary private-equity groups, which prefer steady profits and economically insensitive industries to which they can add lots of leverage. But the unicorns of Silicon Valley have proved attractive to sovereign-wealth funds and a handful of big private funds that search for growth.</p>
<p>The trouble is, Mr. Musk's charms may not work the same magic on them as on the public markets.</p>

<p>Boards have enormous responsibility in corporate deals, especially ones as complex and fraught as the buyout of Tesla that Mr. Musk suggested
  this week. Most of Tesla's directors have close business or personal relationships with Mr. Musk that they would have to balance against their obligation to ensure that any deal serves the interests of Tesla shareholders beyond its famous leader, corporate governance specialists say.</p>
<p>The board's role in the possible buyout was clouded by Mr. Musk's unusual way of announcing the idea--in a sudden, very brief tweet on Tuesday. That tweet was followed more than 20 hours later by a short statement from six directors saying the board had met several times
  since Mr. Musk told it of his go-private idea last week, and that it was "taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this."</p>
<p>The sequence of events suggests that "the board review has been very, very informal," said Adam Epstein, who heads corporate-governance consultant Third Creek Advisors.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's announcement attracted scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission
 , which has asked Tesla whether Mr. Musk was truthful when he said in his tweet that he had secured funding for the buyout.</p>
<p>Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment on the SEC queries.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Tesla shares fell for a second straight day to $352.45, leaving them below their level before Mr. Musk's announcement and about 16% under the $420 target price he set for a buyout of the electric-car maker.</p>
<p>Tesla's board has nine members. Mr. Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, is chairman as well as chief executive. He and his brother, Kimbal, are the only directors the board doesn't label as independent.</p>
<p>Tesla says that it evaluates numerous factors in determining directors' independence, including their commercial, accounting, legal, banking, consulting, charitable and familial relationships.</p>
<p>Several other directors are close to Mr. Musk, including Brad Buss, who was previously chief financial officer at SolarCity, the renewable energy company Mr. Musk led and that Tesla acquired in 2016.</p>
<p>Lead independent director Antonio Gracias, founder of Valor Equity Partners, has invested in several Musk ventures going back to PayPal, which Mr. Musk co-founded. He was a SolarCity director and is a director at Mr. Musk's rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX. The Musk brothers have invested with Valor, according to Tesla's proxy statement.</p>
<p>Ira Ehrenpreis, who heads Tesla's compensation committee and its nominating and governance committee, also is a SpaceX investor, as is Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who is on leave from Tesla's board. Both have been associates of Mr. Musk for years.</p>
<p>Messrs. Gracias, Buss and Ehrenpreis didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Jurvetson declined to comment about the proposed deal and didn't respond to questions about the board's independence.</p>
<p>Board independence has received more attention
  in recent years. Governance specialists point out that regulatory requirements for independence have limited scope.</p>
<p>Todd Henderson, professor at the University of Chicago Law School, says the value of independence can be overstated. Still, he says following normal procedure for cases like Tesla's--such as forming a special committee on the board to consider the buyout--would improve the reception for any deal.</p>
<p>Boards normally play active roles overseeing major transactions, and in management-backed buyouts their importance can be greater because directors must negotiate against CEOs on behalf of other shareholders.</p>
<p>Six months before PC-maker Dell announced founder Michael Dell's plan to take the company private in 2013, its board formed a special committee to negotiate terms with him, according to company filings. When the deal was announced it came with a detailed financing plan including backing from the equity sponsors and debt underwriting from Wall Street banks. Afterwards the board clashed with Mr. Dell and his partners as directors sought a higher price for shareholders. They won a slight increase.</p>
<p>Shareholder advocates have frequently challenged Tesla's board, with little success.</p>
<p>Glass Lewis, one of two major shareholder advisory services, strongly opposed the proposal for Tesla to buy SolarCity, calling it a "thinly veiled bail-out plan" and saying the Tesla board was "rife with conflicts." Shareholders approved the deal.</p>
<p>Last year, under pressure from shareholders including California State Teachers' Retirement System to add two independent directors
 , Tesla announced the addition of James Murdoch, CEO of 21st Century Fox, and Linda Johnson Rice, CEO of Johnson Publishing Co. (21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.)</p>
<p>This year, when Mr. Murdoch was up for re-election, Glass Lewis and rival adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended against him, saying he had too many other board and executive commitments to provide effective oversight. Mr. Murdoch was re-elected with 90% of the votes.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Murdoch declined to comment. Ms. Johnson Rice, who wasn't up for reelection, didn't respond to an email.</p>
<p>Also this year, the Tesla board's compensation committee--composed of Mr. Buss, Mr. Gracias, Mr. Ehrenpreis and Robyn Denholm, chief operating officer of Telstra Corp.--recommended a 10-year compensation package for Mr. Musk that Tesla valued at $2.6 billion. Tesla said the package would incentivize Mr. Musk to remain and would help Tesla achieve its goals.</p>
<p>The two advisory services both blasted the proposal, with ISS saying "the grant value is unprecedented and sets the new high-water mark for an individual executive equity award at a U.S. public company."</p>
<p>Shareholders approved the package in March with 85% of the vote.</p>

 .</p>
<p>"As long as it's an option for me to invest my money alongside Elon, I'm going to," said James Stephenson, who says he has been a Tesla investor since 2014.</p>
<p>Whether individuals and some institutional investors will be able to stay in Tesla will depend on how a deal is structured, though. Some holders of Tesla stock could face hurdles to participating.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has said he wants to take Tesla private
 , giving investors a choice: stay with the company or sell their shares and receive $420 cash for each. The more shareholders who opt to stay, the less cash the company or any new investor would have to pony up.</p>
<p>And funding 
 for a deal is a big question
 . Tesla, which has dwindling cash reserves and continues to generate negative free-cash flow, hasn't given any detail on how it would fund a buyout.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk tweeted "funding secured," but a later statement from several Tesla board members
  was less definitive. It said a meeting with Mr. Musk a week earlier had "also addressed the funding for this to occur."</p>
<p>Individual shareholders like Mr. Stephenson hold about 12% of Tesla's stock, according to FactSet, and many say they won't go. The 40-year-old financial analyst who lives in Florida said he wants to hold on to his Tesla shares, which he says number 169 and were worth around $60,000 based on Thursday's close.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to sell at $420, and most other Tesla shareholders I've spoken with aren't going to sell either," said Mr. Stephenson, adding he expects Tesla to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization over the next decade, versus around $60 billion today.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk said in one tweet this week 
 that he would create "a special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla," but the car maker and Mr. Musk haven't elaborated on how such a vehicle would work. Usually, individual investors who don't meet certain income and asset criteria face steep regulatory barriers to participating in a buyout.</p>
<p>What's more, almost 8% of Tesla shareholders are index funds that follow benchmarks that exclude unlisted companies, according to Morningstar. Most of those would likely have to cash out since they can't generally hold stock not included in public markets or an index.</p>
<p>An additional 24% of shareholders are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that face limits on holdings of securities that don't trade easily. In most cases, they can't have more than 15% of their portfolio in illiquid securities.</p>
<p>These funds, which are among Tesla's biggest shareholders, have yet to say how they would react to a go-private transaction. T. Rowe Price Associates, Tesla's second-largest holder after Mr. Musk, with a 9.2% stake, declined to comment. So, too, did No. 3 holder Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co., with an 8.16% stake.</p>
<p>Baillie Gifford, the next largest holder, said in a statement: "As long-term shareholders, we will take time to reflect upon this development."</p>
<p>Vanguard Group, which is Tesla's sixth-largest holder, owns shares mostly through index funds, which would likely have to sell. "Our active funds are technically able to invest in private companies, but it is rare for them to do so," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Some smaller fund managers say they are on board. Craig Blanchfield, a portfolio manager at Mosaic Advisors, a money manager that oversees more than $241 million, said he wants to continue to hold Tesla shares. He said Tesla has already been a lucrative investment for him, as well as clients for whom he manages money.</p>
<p>Mr. Blanchfield added that Mr. Musk's penchant for success--from revolutionizing payments with PayPal Holdings Inc. to building rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp.--is a key reason behind his plan to hold Tesla shares indefinitely. "This is an example of betting on the jockey, not the horse," said Mr. Blanchfield.</p>
<p>The $174.7 million Ark Industrial Innovation ETF, an actively managed fund from Ark Investment Management, is another committed bull. Tesla is its largest holding, accounting for 11.7% of the fund's portfolio, according to FactSet. Two other Ark ETFs own smaller stakes in Tesla.</p>
<p>"We think that $420 is a very low price to pay for Tesla today," said Tasha Keeney, an analyst with Ark Investment Management. The fund would prefer Tesla stay public because liquidity limits might push it to sell, but she argued that the market is underestimating the growth of battery-powered cars.</p>
<p>Factoring that in, Ms. Keeney estimated Tesla's shares could reach $4,000 in five years.</p>
<p>The scant detail provided by Mr. Musk has given pause to some steadfast supporters. Galileo Russell, a 25-year-old founder of a financial media startup, HyperChange, geared at millennials, views a take-private move as a "step backwards in terms of liquidity and transparency."</p>
<p>Mr. Russell conceded heavy short selling in Tesla stock, which entails investors betting a share price will decline, has been a distraction for the company, as Mr. Musk has said.</p>
<p>Investors who have placed wagers on Tesla shares falling have accumulated about $12.5 billion in short interest, making the electric-car maker one of the most shorted stocks in the U.S., according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.</p>
<p>"I'm not super convinced going private is the right move," said Mr. Russell. Still, he says he doesn't plan to sell any of his 60 shares, valued at about $21,000. "The financial upside could be huge. I'm holding this for 10, 20, 30 years at least."</p>
<p>For Prem Kalevar, a 29-year-old Canadian entrepreneur, Tesla's long-term potential isn't enough to mask liquidity concerns. Mr. Kalevar said he would sell a meaningful portion of what he says is his low six-figure holding that he has accumulated since 2013 if Mr. Musk takes the company private.</p>
<p>"Given the complexity and uncertainty of holding private company stock, my willingness to hold as large as a position as I do now would go down," Mr. Kalevar said.</p>

<p>This is a trick, of course. There are only 3,500, down from a peak of nearly 7,500 in 1997 and roughly 5,000 when the benchmark launched in 1974. There are many reasons to worry about a decline of public companies, but fears about the death of public equity--revived this week by Elon Musk's 
 potential bid to take his electric car maker Tesla private
 --are certainly overdone.</p>
<p>Why worry? Fewer public companies would mean ordinary investors could miss out on good returns from investing in equities. Also, if more firms are in private hands, it is harder for politicians and the public to monitor and influence corporate behavior. That has real potential consequences for employment, the economy and the environment.</p>
<p>Corporate complaints about being public are well rehearsed. Shareholders focused on quarterly results stymie corporate development and long-term growth. The costs and governance demands
  are too onerous. One of Europe's biggest private-equity firms, Partners Group, says public markets suffer excessive "governance correctness," which restrains entrepreneurial spirit and forces companies to employ independent directors
  who lack insight. (Ironically, Partners is itself publicly listed.)</p>
<p>The signs of decline are equally well known. Public companies get picked off by deal-hungry private equity, or they use debt to buy back their own stock. There has been a dearth of initial public offerings, especially by $1 billion-plus tech "unicorns," which remain in the hands of founders and venture capital funds. In the U.S., 2014 was the best year for more than a decade for IPOs, but volumes have been weaker before and since, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p>But is this really a problem with going public? Many entrepreneurs want to keep control of their creations for as long as possible. On top of this, modern businesses simply need less investment to get going, argues Brian Cheffins, a corporate law professor at Cambridge University in a new paper.</p>
<p>Modern company assets are mostly intangible rather than physical: intellectual property, branding and patents rather than machines and buildings. Apple doesn't manufacture phones and its physical assets are worth $38 billion, a tiny fraction of its $1 trillion market valuation.</p>
<p>Startups today, as in the dot-com boom, still burn large amounts of cash, but Prof. Cheffins says this is to fund growth, not to build the physical capital needed to launch production. And this funding is now available in many forms: not just private capital but also debt, which is made more attractive by tax advantages and an ageing society's desire to take less risk.</p>
<p>But for all the growth in private assets and corporate debt, public stock markets are still bigger. The market value of all U.S. stocks is higher than ever at more than $30 trillion. That sits against more than $6 trillion of high-grade U.S. corporate bonds at face value and about $5 trillion for all private assets under management globally.</p>
<p>Also, more than half of private-equity owned firms are sold to other corporations, according to PitchBook, a research firm. Like all the startups bought by Alphabet, or SoftBank, many potential IPO candidates still end up in public hands.</p>
<p>U.S. stock markets have fewer companies, but they are bigger. That may mean a concentration of economic and political power, which might be as troubling as a lack of transparency and accountability in private markets. But one thing investors needn't worry about is the death of public-company equity.</p>

<p>He likely would not have achieved these successes if he weren't a little crazy. One reader emails to compare him, both flatteringly and unflatteringly, to Howard Hughes.</p>
<p>Now our suspicious friends at the Securities and Exchange Commission are curious about Mr. Musk's tweet of last Tuesday, in which he claimed to have "secured" funding for a Tesla buyout at $420 a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk surely had something in mind when he wrote these words, but I doubt that it will meet the SEC's definition of "secured."</p>
<p>A conventional, SEC-fearing CEO would never have proposed a buyout via tweet. If he had, an army of lawyers would have been standing at his elbow. Of no other CEO is it imaginable that he might blurt out such a thing for its effect, without consulting anybody or even having his facts straight.</p>
<p>With Mr. Musk, it's just plausible. In some ways, he's a throwback to 19th-century capitalism but with 21st-century tools. With a 19th-century CEO, all in a day's work was to manipulate the share price, to ramp it up to facilitate a financing, implement a short squeeze, etc. Read about the doings of Daniel Drew, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Jay Gould. Anything went and investors knew it. Their contemporaries probably did not doubt they were a little crazy too.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk already risked trouble with the SEC over his numerous assurances
  that Tesla did not need fresh capital this year, a claim many analysts on Wall Street flatly contradict. Then there are his countless production forecasts that haven't been borne out.</p>
<p>Till now, the SEC's long leash amounted to, wittingly or otherwise, an experiment in 19th-century capitalism. Tesla was the right company for it: avidly followed by the global media and by analysts, critically dissected by short sellers. You have an unconstrained CEO acting however he wants. You also have an exceptionally well-informed market monitoring his actions, his statements, even his psychology. If any shareholder feels aggrieved or cheated at this point, he or she should look in the mirror. In the meantime, would the situation be any different in the absence of our possibly irrelevant mountain of "investor protection" regulation?</p>
<p>That said, his buyout proposal, after initially boosting the stock price, has stopped helping. A leveraged buyout, featuring large amounts of debt, is unlikely in a company whose cash-generating capacity is already overtaxed. An equity-for-equity buyout may be what Mr. Musk is thinking of, but why would anybody pay $420 for what could be had for $355 today? Such a transaction presumably would be premised on some large, value-creating advantage in being private, but nobody other than Mr. Musk can see it. No private-market valuation would be as friendly to Tesla as the public markets have been, nor would private markets be so willing to fork up new cash to sustain its money-losing car business.</p>
<p>One keeps coming back to Mr. Musk's serially repeated promise that Tesla was done raising money, that it can finance its future capital needs out of sales revenue.</p>
<p>It's hard not to suspect this is a statement of necessity rather than desire. Mr. Musk knows he risks popping the Musk bubble if he goes back to the market one time too many. His board cannot be unaware that Mr. Musk's aura and celebrity are a key prop under the stock price, which is a key prop under the company's economics. This creates a dilemma for them too.</p>
<p>Not to elicit howls, but Enron was a company that found itself trying to sustain a stock price its underlying business couldn't support. Here was an overlooked progenitor of what became the signature corporate scandal of its era. A gas-pipeline company that was selling for $20 suddenly was boosted to $90 based on internet-era hype about the commodification of everything. Notice any similarity to today's belief among a certain public that Tesla is solving the climate problem and government policy will guarantee Elon's success? What followed, at Enron, was management's resort to funky, illegal and then frankly piratical measures to support a valuation received from investors intoxicated with new-age thinking.</p>
<p>In its day, Enron could have swallowed hard and let investors catch up with the fact that its earnings, while real, were never going to meet expectations. Enron likely would have survived instead of self-immolating. Could Tesla undergo a realistic markdown in its share price and survive? That may be Mr. Musk's most searing challenge of all.</p>

<p>"As long as it's an option for me to invest my money alongside Elon, I'm going to," said James Stephenson, who says he has been a Tesla investor since 2014.</p>
<p>Whether individuals and some institutional investors will be able to stay in Tesla will depend on how a deal is structured, though. Some holders of Tesla stock could face hurdles to participating.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has said he wants to take Tesla private, giving investors a choice: stay with the company or sell their shares and receive $420 cash for each. The more shareholders who opt to stay, the less cash the company and any new investors would have to pony up.</p>
<p>And funding for a deal is a big question. Tesla, which has dwindling cash reserves and continues to generate negative free-cash flow, hasn't given any detail on how it would fund a buyout.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk tweeted "funding secured" in broaching a buyout on Tuesday, but a later statement from several Tesla board members was less definitive. It said a meeting with Mr. Musk a week earlier had "also addressed the funding for this to occur."</p>
<p>Individual shareholders like Mr. Stephenson hold about 12% of Tesla's stock, according to FactSet, and many say they won't go. The 40-year-old financial analyst and Florida resident said he wants to hold on to his Tesla shares, which he says number 169 and were worth around $60,000 based on Friday's closing price of $355.49.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to sell at $420, and most other Tesla shareholders I've spoken with aren't going to sell either," said Mr. Stephenson, adding he expects Tesla to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization over the next decade, versus around $60 billion today.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk said in one tweet this week that he would create "a special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla," but the car maker and Mr. Musk haven't elaborated on how such a funding vehicle would work. Usually, individual investors who don't meet certain income and asset criteria face steep regulatory barriers to participating in a buyout.</p>
<p>What's more, almost 8% of Tesla shareholders are index funds that follow benchmarks that exclude unlisted companies, according to Morningstar. Most of those would likely have to cash out since they can't generally hold stock not included in public markets or an index.</p>
<p>An additional 24% of shareholders are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that face limits on holdings of securities that don't trade easily. In most cases, they can't have more than 15% of their portfolio in illiquid securities.</p>
<p>These funds, which are among Tesla's biggest shareholders, have yet to say how they would react to a go-private transaction. T. Rowe Price Associates, Tesla's second-largest holder after Mr. Musk, with a 9.2% stake, declined to comment. So, too, did No. 3 holder Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co., which has an 8.16% stake.</p>
<p>Baillie Gifford, the next largest holder, said in a statement: "As long-term shareholders, we will take time to reflect upon this development."</p>
<p>Vanguard Group, which is Tesla's sixth-largest holder, owns shares mostly through index funds, which would likely have to sell. "Our active funds are technically able to invest in private companies, but it is rare for them to do so," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Some smaller fund managers say they are on board. Craig Blanchfield, a portfolio manager at Mosaic Advisors, a money manager that oversees more than $241 million, said he wants to continue to hold Tesla shares. He said Tesla has already been a lucrative investment for him, as well as clients for whom he manages money.</p>
<p>Mr. Blanchfield added that Mr. Musk's penchant for success -- from revolutionizing payments with PayPal Holdings Inc. to building rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp. -- is a key reason behind his plan to hold Tesla shares indefinitely. "This is an example of betting on the jockey, not the horse," said Mr. Blanchfield.</p>
<p>The $174.7 million Ark Industrial Innovation ETF, an actively managed fund from Ark Investment Management, is another committed bull. Tesla is its largest holding, accounting for 11.7% of the fund's portfolio, according to FactSet.</p>
<p>"We think that $420 is a very low price to pay for Tesla today," said Tasha Keeney, an analyst with Ark Investment Management. The fund would prefer Tesla stay public because liquidity limits might push it to sell, but she argued that the market is underestimating the growth of battery-powered cars. Factoring that in, Ms. Keeney estimated Tesla's shares could reach $4,000 in five years.</p>
<p>The scant detail provided by Mr. Musk has given pause to some steadfast supporters. Galileo Russell, a 25-year-old founder of a financial media startup, HyperChange, geared at millennials, views a take-private move as a "step backwards in terms of liquidity and transparency." Still, he says he doesn't plan to sell any of his 60 shares, valued at roughly $21,000. "The financial upside could be huge. I'm holding this for 10, 20, 30 years at least."</p>

<p>Boards have enormous responsibility in corporate deals, especially ones as complex and fraught as the buyout of Tesla that Mr. Musk suggested this past week. Most of Tesla's directors have close business or personal relationships with Mr. Musk that they would have to balance against their obligation to ensure that any deal serves the interests of Tesla shareholders beyond its famous leader, corporate governance specialists say.</p>
<p>The board's role in the possible buyout was clouded by Mr. Musk's unusual way of announcing the idea -- in a sudden, very brief tweet on Tuesday. That tweet was followed more than 20 hours later by a short statement from six directors saying the board had met several times since Mr. Musk told it of his go-private idea last week, and that it was "taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this."</p>
<p>The sequence of events suggests that "the board review has been very, very informal," said Adam Epstein, who heads corporate-governance consultant Third Creek Advisors.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's announcement attracted scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has asked Tesla whether Mr. Musk was truthful when he said in his tweet that he had secured funding for the buyout. Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment on the SEC queries.</p>
<p>Tesla shares on Friday rose almost 1% to $355.53, leaving them about 15% under the $420 target price Mr. Musk set for a buyout of the electric-car maker.</p>
<p>Tesla's board has nine members. Mr. Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, is chairman as well as chief executive. He and his brother, Kimbal, are the only directors the board doesn't label as independent.</p>
<p>Tesla says that it evaluates numerous factors in determining directors' independence.</p>
<p>Several other directors are close to Mr. Musk, including Brad Buss, who was previously chief financial officer at SolarCity, the renewable energy company Mr. Musk led and that Tesla acquired in 2016.</p>
<p>Lead independent director Antonio Gracias, founder of Valor Equity Partners, has invested in several Musk ventures going back to PayPal, which Mr. Musk co-founded. He was a SolarCity director and is a director at Mr. Musk's rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX. The Musk brothers have invested with Valor, according to Tesla's proxy statement.</p>
<p>Ira Ehrenpreis, who heads Tesla's compensation committee and its nominating and governance committee, also is a SpaceX investor, as is Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who is on leave from Tesla's board. Both have been associates of Mr. Musk for years.</p>
<p>Messrs. Gracias, Buss and Ehrenpreis didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Jurvetson declined to comment about the proposed deal and didn't respond to questions about the board's independence.</p>
<p>Boards normally play active roles overseeing major transactions, and in management-backed buyouts their importance can be greater because directors must negotiate against CEOs on behalf of other shareholders.</p>
<p>Six months before PC-maker Dell announced founder Michael Dell's plan to take the company private in 2013, its board formed a special committee to negotiate terms with him, according to company filings. When the deal was announced it came with a detailed financing plan including backing from the equity sponsors and debt underwriting from Wall Street banks. Afterward the board clashed with Mr. Dell and his partners as directors sought a higher price for shareholders. They won a slight increase.</p>
<p>Shareholder advocates have frequently challenged Tesla's board, with little success. For example, Glass Lewis, one of two major shareholder advisory services, strongly opposed the proposal for Tesla to buy SolarCity, calling it a "thinly veiled bail-out plan" and saying the Tesla board was "rife with conflicts." Shareholders approved the deal.</p>

<p>Nasdaq resumed trading in Tesla Inc. shares at 3:45 ET Tuesday after a halt. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that shares resumed trading at 2:45. (Aug. 12, 2018) </p>
<p>There's a nagging question on Wall Street after Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk's buyout tweet last week
 : Why did Nasdaq let trading in Tesla shares continue for more than an hour afterward?</p>
<p>Mr. Musk tweeted at 12:48 p.m. ET on Tuesday that he had "financing secured" for a buyout of Tesla at $420 a share, a 16% premium to the share price at the time. The remark set off a frenzy of trading in Tesla shares, even as investors were struggling to discern whether the tweet was legitimate and what precisely it meant.</p>
<p>It wasn't until 2:08 p.m. that Nasdaq Inc. acted to halt trading in Tesla shares. In that 80-minute interim, investors who bought and sold the shares were potentially disadvantaged by the lack of clear information about the company, some investors said.</p>
<p>Typically, exchanges halt trading in a company's shares when it tells them it is about to release "material news," or information that could sway investors' trading decisions. An exchange typically keeps trading halted until a disclosure provides some clarity.</p>
<p>Other investors wondered why the exchange kept the halt in place for more than an hour and a half, and then why it chose to resume trading at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<p>It's the latest episode to raise questions about the governance of U.S. markets.</p>
<p>"We don't know what efforts Nasdaq engaged in to get a more discrete picture of what was happening," said Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and chief executive of consulting firm Kalorama Partners LLC. "All of this is unprecedented, it's highly problematic and it's not consistent with careful and thoughtful approaches to a difficult subject."</p>
<p>The decision-making behind the trading halt isn't the only mystery surrounding Mr. Musk's tweets. The SEC is looking into their truthfulness
 , The Wall Street Journal reported.</p>
<p>Nasdaq rules require listed companies to notify its MarketWatch division, via an electronic disclosure system, at least 10 minutes before publicly releasing "certain material news announcements" between the hours of 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. ET. Typically, the heads-up allows the exchange to coordinate with the company and evaluate whether to halt trading "pending news"--which compliance experts say levels the playing field for investors making trading decisions.</p>
<p>With Tesla, the time lag between Mr. Musk's tweet and Nasdaq's decision to halt trading suggests the exchange was blindsided by the CEO's tweet--which would constitute a violation of Nasdaq rules, several traders and regulatory experts said.</p>
<p>A Tesla spokesman declined to address whether Tesla had alerted Nasdaq ahead of Mr. Musk's tweet. Nasdaq declined to comment on its communications with Tesla around the tweet.</p>
<p>"In general, when a company discloses news that's potentially material, whether by tweet or otherwise, Nasdaq's procedure is to contact the company immediately," said Joe Christinat, a Nasdaq spokesman. Nasdaq doesn't need a company's permission to halt trading in its shares.</p>
<p>Companies found to have violated exchange rules can be publicly reprimanded or even delisted, according to Nasdaq guidelines.</p>
<p>Some contend Nasdaq should have moved sooner, given the publicity and the spike in Tesla shares that followed both the tweet and a Financial Times report earlier that day about a Saudi sovereign wealth fund building a $2 billion stake in Tesla.</p>
<p>"Everyone I spoke to was wondering" why Nasdaq didn't halt Tesla earlier, said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Baird.</p>
<p>Others say Tesla shouldn't have been allowed to resume trading.</p>
<p>"Trading should have been halted immediately and should not be resumed until Musk either presents or shows the absence of a written commitment to funding," said David Rocker, a retired hedge-fund manager who said the SEC and Nasdaq responses were insufficient. "A continuation of trading at this point is a disservice" to everyone holding or trading the shares.</p>
<p>Stock exchanges, for much of their existence, have operated as nonprofit organizations, each with its own listing standards that companies had to meet in order to be members. But as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange became for-profit public companies in the 2000s and competition heated up to lure listings, some critics contend the exchanges have become beholden to the companies they list.</p>
<p>Unusual trading and unexplained halts are no small matter for U.S. markets that have long been considered the best in the world, experts say.</p>
<p>Reena Aggarwal, a finance professor at Georgetown University and director of the school's Center for Financial Markets, said, "If investors start losing trust in an exchange, then trading is going to move on from there."</p>

<p>The skills he picked up led directly to a full-time offer from Electric Boat, the Rhode Island-based submarine manufacturer, where he is now making $16.50 an hour. "I don't like the idea of going to college -- I wanted to avoid taking on that debt and everything else," Mr. Schorner said. "Being out in the world is a lot more fun."</p>
<p>Coventry High School established its welding program after Electric Boat, one of the state's largest employers, declared it was looking to hire 14,000 new employees in the next decade.</p>
<p>The company wasn't finding enough recruits coming out of college. So it turned to high schools -- where students can be discovered early, and the training is free.</p>
<p>Such direct ties between big companies and local high schools are multiplying. Volkswagen is helping schools in Tennessee modernize their engineering programs; Tesla is partnering with Nevada schools on an advanced manufacturing curriculum; and fisheries in Louisiana have created courses for students to train for jobs in "sustainability."</p>
<p>The renewed popularity of so-called career education programs marks a shift away from the idea that all students should get a liberal-arts education designed to prepare them for college.</p>
<p>Schools are once more deciding it is worth intervening in the lives of students who might not have the academic prowess, or the financial footing, to pursue bachelor's degrees, and instead equip them with skills for steady employment. Nationally, the number of high-school students concentrating in career education has risen 22% over the past decade, to 3.6 million.</p>
<p>The idea has gained currency with politicians, many of whom say technical and career programs can widen the pool of workers 
 in a tight labor market. The U.S. had 6.66 million unfilled job openings 
 at the end of June, just below the highest level on record back in 2000, according to the Labor Department. And the jobless rate
 , at 3.9%, is near lows rarely seen in the past half-century.</p>
<p>Businesses are searching hidden corners of the population to find people with skills they need. For some, that means looking beyond college graduates toward high-school students who might grow into jobs in plants, fisheries and beyond.</p>
<p>A disproportionate share of working-age adults outside the labor force don't have college degrees, White House economists said in a paper released last month
 . Providing vocational skills to those now entering the labor force could set them up for better career prospects, some experts say.</p>
<p>That includes governors, who are clamoring to work with their states' companies to shape curricula. "For a long time, there was a little bit of a stigma around vocational training," said Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island's Democratic governor, but "no matter what neighborhood you're from, you deserve a chance to get a job."</p>
<p>The rapid change in thinking, however, has some parents and advocates worried that students who are poorer or less academically inclined will be funneled into such programs, cutting their career choices at an early stage. By tailoring programs specifically to individual companies, they say, the programs risk handicapping students who want, or need, to make a switch later.</p>
<p>"The culture is so vulnerable to thinking that some children are just not very smart and they should be given a less-challenging course of instruction," said Jeannie Oakes, an emeritus education professor at UCLA.</p>
<p>Supporters say the focus on existing job openings makes more sense than the earlier approach, which trained students in skills like cosmetology or culinary arts regardless of demand.</p>
<p>The current pattern traces back to 1983, when President Reagan created a commission to study why American schools were failing to fill so many Cold War-era technical jobs. Its report, titled "A Nation at Risk
 ," concluded that not enough students were being prepared for college and urged high schools to raise their academic standards, eliminating many vocational programs in the process.</p>
<p>Over the next 30 years, the number of students entering college swelled: in 2015, 1.9 million people earned bachelor's degrees, up from 980,000 in 1985.</p>
<p>Many students took on significant debt to finance their higher education, and some remain unable to pay off loans. That has made industry certificates, which students in the Electric Boat welding program receive, increasingly attractive.</p>
<p>In Rhode Island, Gov. Raimondo has redirected funds from lower-performing training programs toward newer ones in information technology, engineering and welding.</p>
<p>The state has partnered with companies like CVS, which helped set up a curriculum at Davies High School, north of Providence, that trains students to become pharmacy technicians. It features a mock CVS pharmacy with color-coded medicine bins and dummy magazines at the checkout counter.</p>
<p>At Coventry High School, Electric Boat provided welding instructors with a curriculum designed to equip students with the technical skills to work on its submarines.</p>
<p>The instructor, Jamie Cotnoir, said welding attracts a mix of students, but he said slackers can't succeed in the program, which requires fastidious attention to detail around 6000-degree furnaces.</p>
<p>Still, the welding program is itself a cautionary tale: the high school ran a similar program with Electric Boat through the 1990s, but closed it after the company experienced a downturn and laid off workers.</p>
<p>That is a risk, some economists say. "The hot thing in their industry might not be the hot thing two years from now," said Don Coursey, an economist at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Educators are seeking to avoid the mistakes of earlier programs, which were narrowly tailored and sometimes closed off graduates from college. Students in the new programs are often required to take academic classes, including enough English and math, to satisfy precollege requirements.</p>
<p>Tony Carnevale, head of the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, said a careful balance must be struck, because overemphasizing liberal arts can hurt a program's effectiveness at job training.</p>
<p>He cited research showing that career education concentrators earn just 90 cents per hour more
  than students with a regular high school diploma, though that figure doesn't include students earning industry certificates.</p>
<p>"It is a confused space at the moment," Mr. Carnevale said. "It is hard to predict where it goes next."</p>
<p>For Mr. Schorner, the toughest critics initially were his own parents. His mother and stepfather, who considered welding too dirty and dangerous for him, told him they didn't want him to give up on college.</p>
<p>"Now they've kind of seen all the stuff I've been doing," he said. "I guess they're confident with my choices now."</p>

<p>Tesla's only unsecured bonds, a $1.8 billion note issued last August with a 5.3% coupon, have bounced around since Mr. Musk first tweeted his interest in a go-private transaction last week. The most actively traded version of those bonds changed hands late Monday afternoon at 90.750 cents on the dollar for a 6.994% yield, compared with 90.688 cents Friday and 91.5 cents just before the tweet, according to MarketAxess.</p>
<p>In a blog post Monday, Mr. Musk said that "most of the capital required for going private would be funded by equity rather than debt" and estimated that two-thirds of shares owned by current investors would remain with the company.</p>
<p>Not counting convertible bonds, which are a hybrid of debt and equity, Tesla's current debt burden is relatively modest, said Steven Oh, global head of credit and fixed income at PineBridge Investments. Nevertheless, its 5.3% bonds "have been underwater since shortly after new issuance," suggesting it could have serious difficulty "making the leap toward a much higher leveraged capital structure."</p>
<p>Even if Tesla could go private with a minimal amount of new debt, its reputation still could take a hit in the bond market. While the company has burned cash every year since going public, some investors have been comfortable owning its bonds based on its lofty public-market capitalization--which provides a daily assurance that the company is valued more than enough to repay its debt--and its ability to raise cash by issuing new shares.</p>
<p>For debt investors, "the extreme majority of the time you'd prefer them to be a public entity where they can tap markets if necessary," said Troy Johnson, director of fixed-income research at Segall Bryant &amp; Hamill.</p>
<p>Tesla's access to the debt markets is important even now because it faces looming cash needs and has shown reluctance in recent years to issue new shares, as opposed to various types of bonds.</p>
<p>Tesla reported $2.2 billion of cash at the end of the second quarter, along with $9.5 billion in long-term debt and capital leases. Over the past year, the company burned through roughly $2.4 billion of cash with interest expense totaling $577 million, according to the research firm CreditSights.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has repeatedly said the company can start generating cash in the second half of this year and doesn't need to raise more capital. Some analysts disagree, saying the company likely will need to raise billions over the next few quarters to fund ongoing operations and pay down convertible-debt maturities worth a combined $1.15 billion.</p>
<p>In a report Thursday, Moody's Investors Service reiterated its view that "Tesla will need to access the capital markets in order to fund its operating requirements" and repay convertible bonds. It called Mr. Musk's recent statements "a credit negative," though it maintained the company's B3 speculative-grade rating.</p>
<p>The details of a go-private deal are important for current Tesla bondholders. Under the terms of the 5.3% bonds, Tesla would have to tender for the notes at 101 cents on the dollar if any investor or group of investors acquires a majority stake in the company and the bonds are downgraded by credit-rating firms. However, Mr. Musk's comments indicate that a private Tesla might have no majority owner.</p>

  provided new information about what led to his surprise tweet last Tuesday announcing the possible transaction
 . But the new post also left unanswered a host of big questions including how much capital would be required and whether the Saudi fund is indeed able and willing to provide it.</p>
<p>The blog post underlined how unorthodox Mr. Musk's approach has been to a possible transaction. He said the claim in his tweet that funding for a potential deal was "secured" stemmed from a July 31 meeting where the Saudi fund's managing director "strongly expressed his support for funding a going private transaction."</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Musk made clear that no final deal for financing was in place. He said that after his announcement last week, the Saudi fund's managing director expressed support for a privatization subject to due diligence by the fund and to "their internal review process for obtaining approvals." And the official asked for additional information "including any required percentages and any regulatory requirements," Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p>The CEO's post Monday also said a deal would require far less than $70 billion--Tesla's approximate market value based on Mr. Musk's stated target price of $420--and wouldn't necessitate significant borrowing because he believes enough shareholders would be willing to hold on to their stakes.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk, who owns roughly 20% of Tesla, is facing criticism on Wall Street for the way he disclosed the potential plan to go private without providing details. The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about Mr. Musk's tweets
 , The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk said he continues to have discussions with the Saudi fund, which has a nearly 5% stake in Tesla, as well as with a number of other investors.</p>
<p>A person familiar with the fund, called the Public Investment Fund, cautioned that while discussions have taken place, the fund hasn't made a detailed proposal, in part because of questions centering on its potential rights as a foreign investor.</p>
<p>Many obstacles remain to a deal, the person said, including the likely opposition of some top officials and the difficulty of embarking on any major new investment project. But a deal could still happen if it has the backing of Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the PIF, the person said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the PIF declined to comment. Representatives for the Saudi government couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk also said Monday that it would be "premature" to ask shareholders to decide now on going private, as complete details of the deal's structure and funding haven't been provided. He emphasized that full details of the plan--"including the proposed nature and source of the funding to be used"--would be provided before shareholders are asked to decide on going private.</p>
<p>"The only way I could have meaningful discussions with our largest shareholders was to be completely forthcoming with them about my desire to take the company private," Mr. Musk wrote. "However, it wouldn't be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk and Tesla insiders together own just over 25% of the company, according to FactSet. Just over 12% of Tesla's investors are individuals and others. The remaining 62.2% of shares are held by institutions led by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity and Baillie Gifford &amp; Co.</p>
<p>While it isn't yet clear exactly how a going-private deal would be structured, Mr. Musk might have to find a way around regulatory limits on shareholders in privately held companies.</p>
<p>He estimated about two-thirds of all shares owned by current investors would be rolled over into a private Tesla. Last week, he suggested creating a "special purpose fund" to enable current investors to stay with Tesla.</p>
<p>But under current SEC rules, companies must register their securities with the agency if they have more than 500 "nonaccredited" investors--individual investors below certain income and wealth thresholds--as shareholders of record. In addition, a public company can't go private and end its registration or filing obligations with the SEC if it has more than 300 shareholders.</p>
<p>Tesla had 1,156 shareholders of record as of Jan. 31, according to its annual report, along with many more shareholders whose shares are held in "street name" by banks or brokerages.</p>
<p>The idea to take Tesla private comes after the company faced months of scrutiny over missing self-imposed deadlines
  to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan, and over the impact the delays have had
  on Tesla's dwindling cash position.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has resisted the notion Tesla needed to raise more money and has said it can turn a profit this quarter and next now that its factory is building 5,000 Model 3s a week.
  In his blog post, Mr. Musk said it would be unwise for Tesla to take on significant debt in going private.</p>

<p>Its sovereign-wealth fund is considering raising its nearly 5% holding in Tesla, people familiar with the matter said. Discussions among Saudi officials about increasing the Public Investment Fund's stake accelerated after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk last week proposed to take the car company private
  in a tweet, the people said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr. Musk said in a blog post
  that he had been in discussions with the fund since early last year about a major investment that would help Tesla go private. In recent months, executives from PIF have approached Tesla multiple times about investing in the company, the people said.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether the Saudi fund is actively in talks with Mr. Musk about a plan to take the auto maker private, and whether it would have the financing available to do so. Two people familiar with PIF's finances said they doubt there are any serious discussions under way about the fund taking a significantly larger stake in Tesla. Indeed, the fund is struggling to find ways to finance its existing commitments.</p>
<p>A spokesman for PIF declined to comment.</p>
<p>Still, a deal with Tesla would represent an extraordinary wager on technologies that compete with Saudi Arabia's biggest generator of income: oil. Tesla's electric vehicles, if manufactured inside the kingdom, would complement other technology investments and create a base of industry that some Saudi officials are calling the "Grand Vision" of the future, said one person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has said it will build a massive solar-power generation project that would replace oil-and-gas-generated electricity and create a solar-panel and battery manufacturing hub in the Middle East. The country's plans go beyond the solar project and electric cars. It also wants to build a city in the desert called Neom
 , which would be powered by renewable energy and showcase robots and driverless cars. Officials hope the plan will draw global technology investment and innovation.</p>
<p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed, who is behind many of these initiatives, earlier this year toured Silicon Valley scouting for deals and he hopes to draw expertise to the kingdom by snapping up stakes in tech firms, Saudi officials have said. The 32-year-old royal has also driven recent discussions about increasing his country's stake in Tesla, the people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>There are potentially significant financial hurdles to a deal because of PIF's funding constraints and commitments. The government is turning to state oil company Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, to raise tens of billions of debt that will indirectly fund PIF, after shelving a plan to list the oil company and use the proceeds to fund the sovereign-wealth fund.</p>
<p>The public offering was expected to raise about $100 billion. Saudi officials are now instead proceeding with an alternative plan for Aramco to buy a controlling stake in a petrochemical company from the country's sovereign-wealth fund, people familiar with the process said. The deal, if successful, could put $50 billion to $70 billion into PIF's coffers.</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to get more cash, the sovereign-wealth fund is also currently in the market for international loans, the people said.</p>
<p>The unusual funding strategy is a function of Saudi Arabia's tight finances. Even though oil prices recently have risen, the government is running a budget deficit this year after announcing the biggest fiscal stimulus package
  in the country's history.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is nearing a national debt limit of 30% that it set to help clear its fiscal deficit by 2023. The country turned to the international debt markets for the first time two years ago and has since raised at least $40 billion in sovereign debt to fuel spending. It is expected to raise more debt this year, increasing its ratio of debt to gross domestic product to 19%.</p>
<p>PIF already has already outlined tens of billions of commitments
  to outside investors and new projects, including $20 billion to a planned infrastructure fund managed by Blackstone Group LP, $45 billion to a technology fund led by SoftBank Group Corp. and as a key investor in Neom, the $500 billion futuristic city.</p>

<p>A person familiar with Silver Lake's thinking said it is helping Mr. Musk explore the process of going private, but isn't being paid, nor sponsoring or participating in any deal.</p>

<p>Mr. Musk, who owns roughly 20% of Tesla, is facing criticism on Wall Street for the way he disclosed the potential plan to go private without providing details. The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about Mr. Musk's tweets
 , The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk said he continues to have discussions with the Saudi fund, which has a nearly 5% stake in Tesla, as well as with a number of other investors.</p>
<p>A person familiar with the fund, called the Public Investment Fund, cautioned that while discussions have taken place, the fund hasn't made a detailed proposal, in part because of questions centering on its potential rights as a foreign investor.</p>
<p>Many obstacles remain to a deal, the person said, including the likely opposition of some top officials and the difficulty of embarking on any major new investment project. But a deal could still happen if it has the backing of Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the PIF, the person said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the PIF declined to comment. Representatives for the Saudi government couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk also said Monday that it would be "premature" to ask shareholders to decide now on going private, as complete details of the deal's structure and funding haven't been provided. He emphasized that full details of the plan--"including the proposed nature and source of the funding to be used"--would be provided before shareholders are asked to decide on going private.</p>
<p>"The only way I could have meaningful discussions with our largest shareholders was to be completely forthcoming with them about my desire to take the company private," Mr. Musk wrote. "However, it wouldn't be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk and Tesla insiders together own just over 25% of the company, according to FactSet. Just over 12% of Tesla's investors are individuals and others. The remaining 62.2% of shares are held by institutions led by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity and Baillie Gifford &amp; Co.</p>
<p>While it isn't yet clear exactly how a going-private deal would be structured, Mr. Musk might have to find a way around regulatory limits on shareholders in privately held companies.</p>
<p>He estimated about two-thirds of all shares owned by current investors would be rolled over into a private Tesla. Last week, he suggested creating a "special purpose fund" to enable current investors to stay with Tesla.</p>
<p>But under current SEC rules, companies must register their securities with the agency if they have more than 500 "nonaccredited" investors--individual investors below certain income and wealth thresholds--as shareholders of record. In addition, a public company can't go private and end its registration or filing obligations with the SEC if it has more than 300 shareholders.</p>
<p>Tesla had 1,156 shareholders of record as of Jan. 31, according to its annual report, along with many more shareholders whose shares are held in "street name" by banks or brokerages.</p>
<p>The idea to take Tesla private comes after the company faced months of scrutiny over missing self-imposed deadlines
  to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan, and over the impact the delays have had
  on Tesla's dwindling cash position.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has resisted the notion Tesla needed to raise more money and has said it can turn a profit this quarter and next now that its factory is building 5,000 Model 3s a week.
  In his blog post, Mr. Musk said it would be unwise for Tesla to take on significant debt in going private.</p>

<p>Mr. Musk's blog post on Tesla's website Monday provided new information about what led to his surprise tweet last Tuesday announcing the possible transaction. But the new post also left unanswered a host of questions including how much capital would be required and whether the Saudi fund is indeed able and willing to provide it.</p>
<p>The blog post underlined how unorthodox Mr. Musk's approach has been to a possible transaction. He said the claim in his tweet that funding for a potential deal was "secured" stemmed from a July 31 meeting at which the Saudi fund's managing director "strongly expressed his support for funding a going private transaction."</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Musk made clear no final deal for financing was in place. He said that after his announcement last week, the Saudi fund's managing director expressed support for a privatization subject to due diligence by the fund and to "their internal review process for obtaining approvals." And the official asked for additional information "including any required percentages and any regulatory requirements," Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p>The CEO's post Monday also said a deal would require far less than $70 billion -- Tesla's approximate market value based on Mr. Musk's stated target price of $420 -- and wouldn't necessitate significant borrowing because he believes enough shareholders would be willing to hold on to their stakes.</p>
<p>Late Monday, Mr. Musk said in a tweet that he had taken on as advisers several blue-chip names in the worlds of business deals and law: investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc., investment firm Silver Lake, and law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson.</p>
<p>A person familiar with Silver Lake's thinking said it is helping Mr. Musk "explore the process of going private," but isn't being paid, nor sponsoring or participating in any deal.</p>
<p>Goldman declined to comment. Wachtell Lipton and Munger Tolles didn't immediately respond to emails requesting comment.</p>

<p>Tesla's only unsecured bonds, a $1.8 billion note issued in August 2017 with a 5.3% coupon, have bounced around since Mr. Musk first tweeted his interest in a go-private transaction last week. The most actively traded version of those bonds changed hands late Monday afternoon at 90.750 cents on the dollar for a 6.994% yield, compared with 90.688 cents Friday and 91.5 cents just before the tweet, according to MarketAxess.</p>
<p>In a blog post Monday, Mr. Musk said that "most of the capital required for going private would be funded by equity rather than debt" and estimated that two-thirds of shares owned by current investors would remain with the company.</p>
<p>Not counting convertible bonds, which are a hybrid of debt and equity, Tesla's debt burden is relatively modest, said Steven Oh, global head of credit and fixed income at PineBridge Investments. Nevertheless, its 5.3% bonds "have been underwater since shortly after new issuance," suggesting it could have difficulty "making the leap toward a much higher leveraged capital structure."</p>
<p>Even if Tesla could go private with a minimal amount of new debt, its reputation still could take a hit in the bond market. While the company has burned cash every year since going public, some investors have been comfortable owning its bonds based on its lofty public-market capitalization -- which provides a daily assurance that the company is valued at more than enough to repay its debt -- and its ability to raise cash by issuing new shares.</p>
<p>For debt investors, "the extreme majority of the time you'd prefer them to be a public entity where they can tap markets if necessary," said Troy Johnson, director of fixed-income research at Segall Bryant &amp; Hamill.</p>
<p>Tesla's access to the debt markets is important even now because it faces looming cash needs and has shown reluctance in recent years to issue new shares, as opposed to various types of bonds.</p>
<p>Tesla reported $2.2 billion of cash at the end of the second quarter, along with $9.5 billion in long-term debt and capital leases. Over the past year, the company burned through roughly $2.4 billion of cash with interest expense totaling $577 million, according to the research firm CreditSights.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has repeatedly said the company can start generating cash in the second half of this year and doesn't need to raise more capital. Some analysts disagree, saying the company likely will need to raise billions over the next few quarters to fund continuing operations and pay down convertible-debt maturities valued at a combined $1.15 billion.</p>
<p>In a report Thursday, Moody's Investors Service reiterated its view that "Tesla will need to access the capital markets in order to fund its operating requirements" and repay convertible bonds. It called Mr. Musk's recent statements "a credit negative," though it maintained the company's B3 speculative-grade rating.</p>
<p>The details of a go-private deal are important for current Tesla bondholders. Under terms of the 5.3% bonds, Tesla would have to tender for the notes at 101 cents on the dollar if any investor or group of investors acquires a majority stake in the company and the bonds are downgraded by credit-rating firms. However, Mr. Musk's comments indicate that a private Tesla might have no majority owner.</p>

<p>The common perception is that Saudi Arabia's oil wealth gives the fund unlimited resources, but in reality the kingdom's finances are tight, advisers and government officials say.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has become one of the world's most high-profile investors over the past two years, as its 32-year-old Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, seeks to diversify the economy away from its reliance on oil.</p>
<p>The vehicle at the center of the effort is the sovereign-wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund, or PIF. It has committed $65 billion to two enormous outside funds--up to $20 billion for a planned infrastructure investment vehicle managed by Blackstone Group LP and $45 billion for a technology fund led by SoftBank Group. It has also written a total of more than $4 billion of checks to Silicon Valley startups including Uber Technologies Inc., Magic Leap Inc. and Noon.com.</p>
<p>PIF is also on the hook to contribute an unknown sum to Neom, the $500 billion futuristic megacity to be constructed in northwest Saudi Arabia abutting the Red Sea.</p>
<p>It hasn't been called on to pony up any of the cash committed to Blackstone, as the private-equity firm has yet to make an infrastructure investment out of the new fund. So far, the PIF has met all its obligations to SoftBank's Vision Fund, people familiar with the matter said. The fund recently said it had deployed about one third of its commitment capital.</p>
<p>Still, Saudi officials have become concerned about the kingdom's ability to fund those commitments, let alone make a big new one, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>The people are skeptical the fund has any serious plans to take a sizable stake in Tesla beyond the nearly 5% it recently bought.</p>
<p>As of last year, PIF officials and outside consultants were struggling to calculate the fund's value, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Estimates ranged from $200 billion to $300 billion, including assets like a 70% stake in Saudi Basic Industries Co., or Sabic, one of the world's largest petrochemical companies.</p>
<p>Either way, helping fund a buyout of Tesla, which the electric-car maker's Elon Musk says the country has been interested in
 , would be an enormous and complicated undertaking.</p>
<p>It would come after an even bigger and more complex effort--to conduct an initial public offering of state oil company Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Aramco--ran into major difficulties.</p>
<p>After working with more than a dozen banks, law firms and other outside advisers for more than two years on the process, preparations for Aramco's IPO have stalled amid doubts
  about the company's readiness to handle the scrutiny that accompanies a public listing.</p>
<p>More recently, the government and PIF have looked at other avenues to raise financing, as they scramble to find an alternative to the $100 billion they had hoped to raise in the IPO.</p>
<p>The government has been working on a plan by which Aramco would buy a controlling stake in Sabic from PIF. The deal, if successful, could put $50 billion to $70 billion into the fund's coffers. While the kingdom is rushing to execute this transaction, one person close to the process said it was unclear whether it will come together.</p>
<p>The sovereign-wealth fund is also currently in the market for several billion of international loans, some of the people said.</p>
<p>Even though oil prices recently have rebounded, the government is running a budget deficit this year after announcing the biggest fiscal stimulus package in the country's history.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is nearing a national debt limit of 30% that it set to help clear its fiscal deficit by 2023. The country turned to the international debt markets for the first time two years ago and has since raised at least $40 billion to fuel spending.</p>

Chief Executive Elon Musk's revelations that he has talked to Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund
  to provide the cash to take the company private gives regulators more ammunition to fault how he first disclosed it, securities law experts said.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has inquired 
  about Mr. Musk's basis for writing on Twitter last week that he had "funding secured" for the deal. Mr. Musk's Monday statement acknowledged that Saudi Arabia's participation hinges on "financial and other due diligence and their internal review process."</p>
<p>The commission's inquiries, made last week, are preliminary, according to people familiar with the matter. It could become a formal investigation if officials believe a violation of law occurred and that Mr. Musk's conduct caused investor losses. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>Securities lawyers and former SEC officials said Mr. Musk's blog post Monday
  looks like he is trying to show that he had a factual basis for making the announcement on Twitter that he could take the firm private and had the financing to do so.</p>
<p>"The release issued earlier Monday clearly raised at least as many questions as it hopes to answer. The probability that there will be an SEC enforcement action is, I think, quite high," said Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford University and a former SEC commissioner.</p>
<p>Other experts agreed. John Coffee, a securities and corporate law professor at Columbia University, said the SEC can credibly argue that Mr. Musk's tweet last week, which caused Tesla's stock price to jump 11% the day he posted it, didn't give shareholders the full picture they needed.</p>
<p>"This is a clear statement that he has nothing more than an expression of interest as opposed to a binding commitment," Mr. Coffee said. "It will tell the SEC that they have a virtually open-and-shut case if they wish to sue."</p>
<p>A Tesla spokesman declined to comment. The company on Tuesday said it hasn't received a formal proposal to take the company private and that it had formed a special committee 
 to review Mr. Musk's suggestion.</p>
<p>U.S. law forbids companies and corporate officers from providing misleading information about meaningful company events. The SEC's main enforcement tools in any case against Tesla include seeking civil penalties and other types of fines.</p>
<p>Monday's statement "adds to his problems," said James D. Cox, a corporate and securities law professor at Duke University. He noted that Mr. Musk's tweet temporarily pushed Tesla's shares above the trigger price for soon-to-mature Tesla convertible bonds--something that would benefit the company by enabling it to hang onto much-needed cash if the price stays high. The stock has since sunk back below the trigger price.</p>
<p>At least two traders sued Tesla and Mr. Musk in federal court last week, alleging his tweets amounted to fraud. The lawsuits claim that Mr. Musk's remarks artificially drove up Tesla's price, hurting short sellers who bet the price would fall as well as others who bought stock at inflated prices. The company declined to comment on the lawsuits.</p>
<p>Regulators, for their part, would want to know more about his discussions with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, how advanced they were, and whether he talked to outside advisers about how the massive deal could be accomplished, according to securities lawyers.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk said in his Monday statement that he, not Tesla, was behind his tweets and latest statement. That means Tesla's board of directors has to independently weigh any offer that is made. Typically, that requires a company to hire its own advisers and hold a shareholder vote--minus the bidder's participation--to confirm the deal is in the company's best interest and fair to investors.</p>
<p>"I think what was going on this morning was to disassociate himself from Tesla, so Tesla would not be liable for his personal statements," said John O'Hare, a law professor at Northwestern University and former partner at Sidley Austin LLP.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk said Monday that a representative of the Saudi fund as recently as July 31 "strongly expressed his support for funding a going private transaction for Tesla at this time." But the company didn't disclose any talks in a quarterly filing issued on Aug. 6.</p>
<p>Buyouts involving company insiders and controlling shareholders create a thicket of legal complications, according to law professors and attorneys who work on such deals. As a result, companies typically carefully plan how to comply with federal rules and state laws aimed at ensuring a deal is fair.</p>
<p>Management-led buyouts like the one Mr. Musk wants have a built-in conflict of interest, because they create a question of where the CEO's loyalties lie. On one hand, the bidding executive wants to pay a lower price. On the other, the person is supposed to get the best possible valuation for shareholders.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's dual roles as CEO and buyer "poses a governance problem because it's a self-dealing transaction," Mr. Cox said. "The alarm bells go off."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk said Monday that "if and when" a buyout proposal is ready, Tesla's board would appoint the special committee and hire its own advisers.</p>
<p>But it has to be a truly independent committee, with the ability to reject a deal, Mr. Cox said. "This becomes very problematic at Tesla" because many of the board members have longstanding relationships with Mr. Musk
 , he added.</p>

<p>The electric-vehicle maker's chief executive said in a tweet late Monday that he was "excited to work with" as advisers investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and investment firm Silver Lake, two blue-chip names in the world of deals.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, Mr. Musk and Goldman executives were still haggling about the terms of any engagement, according to people familiar with the matter. Silver Lake, meanwhile, is helping Mr. Musk explore the process of going private and considering a potential investment if a transaction proceeds, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday. Silver Lake isn't being paid for financial advice, this person said. The firm doesn't typically advise companies except as part of its investment-evaluation process.</p>
<p>Tesla didn't immediately comment.</p>
<p>The disconnect comes as Tesla's board of directors scurried to put into place a team to evaluate Mr. Musk's idea a week after he first disclosed it. The company said Tuesday the board formed a special committee composed of three board members: Brad Buss, a director since 2009 and the former finance chief at SolarCity Corp., a solar-energy company Tesla bought in 2016; Robyn Denholm, a director since 2014 and the operations chief at Australian telecommunications company Telstra Corp.; and Linda Johnson Rice, CEO of Johnson Publishing Co., who joined Tesla's board in 2017.</p>
<p>Tesla's board committee is contending with an unpredictable CEO who is known to speak his mind and who often reveals corporate developments on Twitter that are typically disclosed by other companies in carefully crafted news releases.</p>
<p>While it isn't unusual for banks like Goldman to take time negotiating the terms of an assignment, the circumstances around the possible Tesla deal are sensitive. The unorthodox way in which it unfolded already is the subject of lawsuits, and Goldman has grown particularly conscious of its reputation in the wake of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Goldman's executives were still discussing with Mr. Musk's camp details of the engagement letter, people familiar with the matter said. Merger-and-acquisition engagement letters typically lay out fees and indemnify banks against legal liability.</p>
<p>What's more, the odds of a buyout appear long. Bankers are typically paid only if transactions are completed. On the other hand, a deal of this size would throw off tens of millions of dollars in fees if it gets done and carry sizable marketing value for a bank like Goldman.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's tweet Monday also named two law firms as advisers: Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson LLP. Wachtell, a longtime Tesla adviser, is working with Mr. Musk to evaluate the matter, said a person familiar with the situation. Munger didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's tweeting extended his unusual approach to the possible take-private deal by declaring support before it appears to be solid.</p>
<p>He shocked investors last week when he said he was considering taking Tesla private and had secured funding for such a deal, which would value the company at more than $70 billion. On Monday, he published a blog post that undermined that contention by saying he had meetings with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund about it providing financial support but that a final deal to provide funds wasn't in place.</p>
<p>His series of tweets last week about his take-private plan drew scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission
 , which has inquired about Mr. Musk's basis for writing the tweets. In detailing his talks with the Saudi fund, Mr. Musk has given regulators even more reason to look at how he went about disclosing the information, securities-law experts said.</p>
<p>These aren't the first examples of Mr. Musk tweeting that a business deal was in place before it was actually done. About a year ago, he claimed on Twitter that he had "verbal" government approval to build a high-speed, tunnel-based travel system called a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C. Representatives for Mr. Musk's tunnel venture, the Boring Co., and the White House both said the two sides had "promising conversations" but didn't confirm there was a verbal agreement, while New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted the announcement was "news to City Hall."</p>
<p>A habitual tweeter, Mr. Musk's casual tone is unique among CEOs of his stature, and that can sometimes get him in trouble. Last month, he suggested a cave rescuer in Thailand was a pedophile, before later deleting the tweets and apologizing.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's comments about his take-private deal have left many questions unanswered, including how much capital would be required for a possible deal and whether the Saudi fund is willing and able to provide it. He made clear no final deal for financing was in place, saying that while the fund's managing director expressed support for a privatization, it was subject to due diligence by the fund and to its "internal review process for obtaining approvals."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk, who is chairman and owns about one-fifth of Tesla, has received solid support from Tesla's board, many of whose members have close relationships to the CEO
 . Mr. Buss, for example, had been finance chief at SolarCity, a company founded by Mr. Musk's cousins and that counted Mr. Musk as its largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Companies often form special committees when considering deals that present possible conflicts of interest, such as when a major shareholder or senior official pursues a takeover.</p>
<p>The company said Tuesday that the committee hasn't yet received a formal proposal. The committee named Latham &amp; Watkins LLP as its legal adviser, while the company has retained Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.</p>

<p>The common perception is that Saudi Arabia's oil wealth gives the fund unlimited resources, but in reality the kingdom's finances are tight, advisers and government officials say.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has become one of the world's most high-profile investors over the past two years, as its 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, seeks to diversify the economy away from its reliance on oil.</p>
<p>The vehicle at the center of the effort is the sovereign-wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund, or PIF. It has committed $65 billion to two enormous outside funds -- up to $20 billion for a planned infrastructure investment vehicle managed by Blackstone Group LP and $45 billion for a technology fund led by SoftBank Group. It also has written a total of more than $4 billion of checks to Silicon Valley startups including Uber Technologies Inc., Magic Leap Inc. and Noon.com.</p>
<p>PIF also is on the hook to contribute an unknown sum to Neom, the $500 billion futuristic megacity to be constructed in northwest Saudi Arabia abutting the Red Sea.</p>
<p>It hasn't been called on to pony up any of the cash committed to Blackstone. So far, the PIF has met all of its obligations to SoftBank's Vision Fund, people familiar with the matter said. The fund recently said it had deployed about one-third of its commitment capital.</p>
<p>Still, Saudi officials have become concerned about the kingdom's ability to fund those commitments, let alone make a big new one, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>The people are skeptical the fund has any serious plans to take a sizable stake in Tesla beyond the nearly 5% it recently bought.</p>
<p>As of last year, PIF officials and outside consultants were struggling to calculate the fund's value, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Estimates ranged from $200 billion to $300 billion.</p>
<p>Helping fund a buyout of Tesla, which the electric-car maker's Elon Musk says the country has been interested in, would be an enormous and complicated undertaking.</p>
<p>It would come after an even bigger and more complex effort -- to conduct an initial public offering of state oil company Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Aramco -- ran into major difficulties.</p>
<p>After working with more than a dozen banks, law firms and other outside advisers for more than two years on the process, preparations for Aramco's IPO have stalled.</p>
<p>More recently, the government and PIF have looked at other avenues to raise financing, as they scramble to find an alternative to the $100 billion they had hoped to raise in the IPO.</p>
<p>The government has been working on a plan by which Aramco would buy a controlling stake in Sabic from PIF. The deal, if successful, could put $50 billion to $70 billion into the fund's coffers. One person close to the process said it was unclear whether it will come together. The sovereign-wealth fund is also currently in the market for several billion of international loans, some of the people said.</p>
<p>Even though oil prices recently have rebounded, the government is running a budget deficit this year after announcing the biggest fiscal stimulus package in the country's history.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is nearing a national debt limit of 30% that it set to help clear its fiscal deficit by 2023.</p>

<p>The electric-vehicle maker's chief executive said in a tweet late Monday that he was "excited to work with" as advisers investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and investment firm Silver Lake, blue-chip names in the deals world.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, Mr. Musk and Goldman executives were still haggling about the terms of any engagement, according to people familiar with the matter. Silver Lake, meanwhile, is helping Mr. Musk explore the process of going private and considering a potential investment if a transaction proceeds, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday. Silver Lake isn't being paid for financial advice, this person said. The firm doesn't typically advise companies except as part of its investment-evaluation process.</p>
<p>Tesla didn't immediately comment.</p>
<p>The disconnect comes as Tesla's board of directors scurried to put into place a team to evaluate Mr. Musk's idea a week after he first disclosed it. The company said Tuesday the board formed a special committee composed of three board members: Brad Buss, a director since 2009 and the former finance chief at SolarCity Corp., a solar-energy company Tesla bought in 2016; Robyn Denholm, a director since 2014 and the operations chief at Australian telecommunications company Telstra Corp.; and Linda Johnson Rice, CEO of Johnson Publishing Co., who joined Tesla's board in 2017.</p>
<p>Tesla's board committee is contending with a CEO who often reveals corporate developments on Twitter that are typically disclosed by other companies in carefully crafted news releases.</p>
<p>While it isn't unusual for banks like Goldman to take time negotiating the terms of an assignment, the circumstances around the possible Tesla deal are sensitive. The way in which it unfolded is the subject of lawsuits.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Goldman's executives were still discussing with Mr. Musk's camp details of the engagement letter, people familiar with the matter said. Merger-and-acquisition engagement letters typically lay out fees and indemnify banks against legal liability.</p>
<p>What's more, the odds of a buyout appear long. Bankers are typically paid only if transactions are completed. On the other hand, a deal of this size would throw off tens of millions of dollars in fees if it gets done and carry sizable marketing value for a bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's tweet Monday also named two law firms as advisers: Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson LLP. Wachtell is working with Mr. Musk to evaluate the matter, said a person familiar with the situation. Munger didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's tweeting extended his unusual approach to the possible take-private deal by declaring support before it appears to be solid.</p>
<p>He shocked investors last week when he said he was considering taking Tesla private and had secured funding for such a deal, which would value the company at more than $70 billion. On Monday, he published a blog post that undermined that contention by saying he had meetings with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund about it providing financial support but that a final deal to provide funds wasn't in place.</p>
<p>These aren't the first examples of Mr. Musk tweeting a business deal was in place before it was done. About a year ago, he claimed on Twitter that he had "verbal" government approval to build a high-speed, tunnel-based travel system from New York City to Washington, D.C. Representatives for Mr. Musk's tunnel venture, the Boring Co., and the White House said the sides had "promising conversations" but didn't confirm there was a verbal agreement, while New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted the announcement was "news to City Hall."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's comments have left questions unanswered, including how much capital would be required for a possible deal and whether the Saudi fund is willing and able to provide it. He made clear no final deal for financing was in place, saying it was subject to due diligence by the fund.</p>

Chief Executive Elon Musk, people familiar with the outreach said. Since then, his country's sovereign-wealth fund has boosted its stake in the car maker, and he is now weighing whether to be part of a deal to take the company private.</p>
<p>The shift shows how quickly Crown Prince Mohammed and his sovereign-wealth fund have become a pivotal global investor. The Public Investment Fund's moves have also brought an element of unpredictability to a $225 billion fund, mirroring the headlong leadership style of 32-year-old Prince Mohammed, who is trying to transform Saudi Arabia from a staid petrostate to a technology-focused economy.</p>
<p>But with its aggressive approach to investment, PIF is also leveraging up, sourcing direct deals and shifting into higher-risk tech startups. Some Saudis worry that it is jeopardizing the wealth of Saudi Arabia's next generation by combining politics and inexperience with impulsive bets on technologies of the future. The talks with electric-car maker Tesla have crystallized those concerns.</p>
<p>"There are several people in the government that would question that deal and whether it is the right call," an adviser to the Saudi government said. "Saudi Arabia wants to go big on electric vehicles but wanting something and making it a reality is something else."</p>
<p>Interviews with advisers and people close to the PIF said the fund sources its potential deals through political and business ties. The crown prince ultimately makes the call whether to go ahead with investments, and in many cases, has forged personal connections with the executives running the companies.</p>
<p>An adviser to the Saudi government said talks about investing more in Tesla included the crown prince, who also is likely to have the final say on increasing PIF's stake.</p>
<p>The Saudi royal toured the U.S. in 2016 in a push for tech deals that included an outreach to Tesla, which was rebuffed, people familiar with the matter said. Tesla declined to comment on the account.</p>
<p>In a blog post on Monday, Mr. Musk said Saudi Arabia had reached out to him two years ago and he started face-to-face talks early last year with the PIF on a major stake.</p>
<p>Since then, the fund built a 4.6% stake via listed shares in Tesla, one of the U.S. stock market's most-shorted stocks. PIF's Chief Executive Yasir Rumayyan currently is working on a detailed proposal to present to the crown prince about increasing PIF's stake in Tesla, the adviser to the Saudi government said.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk stunned markets last week when he shared his thinking over Twitter about taking Tesla private
 . The announcement is now subject to regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>Tesla's directors on Tuesday formed a special committee to evaluate Mr. Musk's suggestion of taking the company private.</p>
<p>The senior Saudi adviser and another person with knowledge of the matter said SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son encouraged the Saudis to buy into Chinese electric-battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., but the crown prince preferred Tesla because it is American.</p>
<p>A spokesman for SoftBank declined to comment on Mr. Son's advice for the crown prince. People close to SoftBank have ruled it out of any deal for Tesla, despite its major partnership with PIF.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for PIF declined to comment. The Saudi government and its royal court didn't respond to phone and email requests for comments on this article.</p>
<p>Officials at the Saudi fund are seeking Tesla's expertise to tie into broader plans to create new industries in solar-power generation, battery storage and electric-vehicle production
 , The Wall Street Journal has reported. The fund, which is talks with banks to raise billions of its own debt, hopes its investments in technology will act as a hedge against the decline of the energy sector.</p>
<p>The PIF isn't alone in investing in technology. Singapore's Temasek Holdings and GIC Private Ltd. and the China Investment Corp. also have become active in venture capital. Although unusual, other sovereigns such as Temasek also have taken on debt.</p>
<p>But the PIF is unique in the size and scope of the investments, said Javier Capap&eacute;, director of the Sovereign Wealth Lab at Madrid's IE Business School.</p>
<p>"PIF investing in tech is part of the country's wider strategy," he said. "What's not very clear to me is how investing in high-tech things will drive your economy or lead you into other sectors to compensate the oil."</p>
<p>The PIF is scrambling to raise money for its investments. The fund is in talks with banks to raise billions of its own debt and plans to use cash from the sale of its stake in Saudi Arabia's national chemicals company to oil giant Aramco, better known Saudi Arabian Oil Co., in a deal worth up to $70 billion.</p>
<p>The PIF's first major international technology investment, in Uber Technologies Inc., was hatched in 2016 after a barbecue in Riyadh attended by PIF's Mr. Rumayyan and then-Uber policy head and former White House official, David Plouffe, people familiar with the deal said. Uber's then-chief, Travis Kalanick, subsequently visited Saudi Arabia to meet Crown Prince Mohammed and the PIF bought $3.5 billion stake within weeks, people familiar with the deal said.</p>
<p>The PIF soon after made an even bigger wager than Uber. It committed $45 billion into Softbank's $100 billion Vision Fund. That deal
  was famously agreed upon in a 45-minute conversation between Crown Prince Mohammed and Mr. Son, before the two sides then spent months agreeing on the details.</p>
<p>A month later in Dubai, Mr. Rumayyan stepped in with another surprising investment.</p>
<p>Emirati billionaire businessman Mohamed Alabbar was set to announce a major new e-commerce startup to take on Amazon Inc. Minutes before Mr. Alabbar took the stage at the Dubai Opera House, the PIF signed an agreement to back the venture, known as Noon, with $500 million, people familiar with this deal said. Although PIF had been reluctant to invest in the startup, Crown Prince Mohammed encouraged the deal because it is also backed by officials in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia's closest ally, the people said.</p>
<p>In March, when Saudi Arabia also took a $400 million stake in augmented- reality startup Magic Leap Inc., people close to the deal were stunned at how quickly it came together--just six days. The speed caught the attention of Silicon Valley's financiers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>"They did the Uber deal and increased their profile as a fund," said an adviser familiar with Saudi government thinking. "When Yasir [Rumayyan] then went to California, everyone wanted to meet him."</p>

<p>The subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission seeks information from each of Tesla's directors, according to a person familiar with the matter. It isn't known what information is being sought.</p>
<p>Representatives for the SEC and Tesla declined to comment.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the SEC has made preliminary inquires about Mr. Musk's basis for writing
  on Twitter last week that he had "funding secured" for a deal.</p>
<p>The subpoena indicates senior SEC officials have authorized a formal investigation of the company, a step up from the initial inquiries the regulator made to Tesla last week. The SEC opens formal investigations when it thinks that a violation of law has occurred and that a probe is justified given the nature of the suspected misconduct and the potential harm to investors.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, companies and corporate officers can't give shareholders misleading information about meaningful company events.</p>
<p>SEC probes take months and sometimes years, and can be closed without legal action against a target if the SEC decides the evidence doesn't merit filing charges.</p>
<p>Fox Business Network earlier reported that Tesla received a subpoena from the SEC.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk surprised investors on Aug. 7 when he tweeted
  that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share, or $72 billion, about 20% above the stock's trading price earlier that day. In his tweet, Mr. Musk said the buyout had "funding secured," without providing any details.</p>
<p>In a blog post on Tesla's website Monday, he clarified that discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund about funding the deal
  were the basis for his assertion, and said the fund hadn't signed off on a deal. The Saudi Public Investment Fund has a nearly 5% stake in Tesla.</p>
<p>Stephen Crimmins, a former SEC lawyer now at Murphy &amp; McGonigle PC, said the regulator probably needed to begin issuing subpoenas because the matter will involve asking questions of the Saudi fund.</p>
<p>"It's likely that in the Tesla matter the SEC staff needed to ask for a formal order of investigation to get subpoena power as a basis for relying on an international agreement between securities regulators to get help from the Saudis," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk also outlined an unorthodox setup for a potential deal, saying he expected a significant number of the company's current shareholders to hold on to their stakes in a take-private deal. He estimated about two-thirds of all shares owned by current investors would be rolled over into a private Tesla.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk and Tesla insiders own about 25% of Tesla, and individual investors hold a little more than 17% of the stock. The rest--nearly 58%--is held by big institutional investors, according to FactSet.</p>
<p>Two of those big shareholders disclosed in regulatory filings Tuesday that they pared their holdings in Tesla
  before the take-private conversations became public last week.</p>
<p>T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Fidelity Investments reduced their stakes by more than 20% in the quarter ended June 30, according to FactSet. T. Rowe sold 3.7 million shares and Fidelity sold 3.1 million shares.</p>
<p>The two investors still own more than 20 million shares combined, according to FactSet, and they remain two of Tesla's five largest institutional holders. It isn't known why they pared their stakes; representatives for the firms declined to comment.</p>
<p>Six of Tesla's other top 15 institutional shareholders also sold smaller stakes during the second quarter, according to FactSet. That included funds or accounts controlled by Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p>
<p>It isn't known how Mr. Musk would get around regulatory limits on the number of shareholders in a private company.</p>
<p>Companies with more than 500 "nonaccredited" investors--individual investors below certain income and wealth thresholds--are required to register their securities with the SEC. In addition, a public company can't go private and end its registration or filing obligations with the SEC if it has more than 300 shareholders.</p>
<p>The development shows how Mr. Musk's erratic behavior and seemingly unfiltered use of Twitter
  is a risk for Tesla, attracting unwanted drama as it tries to evolve into a more mainstream auto maker.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has repeatedly used Twitter to chide investors who are betting against his company, sometimes making boastful statements and offering positive outlooks that can boost the stock and hurt short sellers. He has also used Twitter to criticize regulators, scrutinize the media and debate people who target his business interests.</p>
<p>His defiance and frank messaging has won Mr. Musk many fans and gained him more than 22 million followers on Twitter. But his outbursts sometimes get him into trouble, like it did in July when he lashed out at a British cave explorer who helped rescue a youth soccer team in Thailand, suggesting he was a pedophile. Mr. Musk deleted the tweet and apologized.</p>
<p>The investigation adds another distraction for Tesla as the company struggles to ramp up production of the Model 3, the sedan that Mr. Musk bets will bring electric cars to the masses. The company reached a long-delayed goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a week at the end of the second quarter.</p>
<p>But some investors and analysts question whether Tesla can sustain production to generate the necessary cash needed to fuel the business and turn a profit. Mr. Musk has little room for error as production delays have pushed cash near dangerously low levels.</p>

  that he wanted to take the electric-car maker private, according to filings.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk needs support from a majority of existing shareholders to pull off his surprise proposal
 , which he revealed on Twitter last week.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest holders, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Fidelity Investments, reduced their stakes by more than 20% in the quarter ending June 30, according to FactSet. T. Rowe sold 3.7 million shares and Fidelity sold 3.1 million shares.</p>
<p>It is not known why T. Rowe and Fidelity sold the shares. The two investors still own more than 20 million shares, according to FactSet, and that makes them two of Tesla's five largest institutional holders. The money managers declined to comment.</p>
<p>Six of Tesla's other top 15 institutional shareholders also sold smaller stakes during the second quarter, according to FactSet. That included funds or accounts controlled by Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to FactSet.</p>
<p>A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on why the shares were sold.</p>
<p>In a separate blog post Monday
 , Mr. Musk said he has talked to Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund to provide the cash to take the company private and that the buyout would require far less than $70 billion, the approximate market value based on his proposed price of $420 per share.</p>
<p>"My best estimate right now is that approximately two-thirds of shares owned by all current investors would roll over into a private Tesla," he wrote in the blog post.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has inquired
  about Mr. Musk's basis for writing on Twitter last week that he had "funding secured" for the deal.</p>

<p>Panasonic and Tesla say they never had a contract under which Tesla agreed to buy all the output from a solar-panel factory they operate in Buffalo, N.Y. An earlier version of this article, based on a Panasonic spokeswoman's statement that the company later reversed, said they had an exclusive supply contract. (Aug. 20, 2018) In addition, an earlier version of this article misspelled Tesla's name in the headline as Telsa. (Aug. 16, 2018)</p>
<p>TOKYO--Panasonic Corp. said it has begun to sell some of the output from a solar-panel factory it operates with Tesla Inc. to non-Tesla customers, another sign of the uncertain outlook for Tesla's SolarCity subsidiary.</p>
<p>Panasonic said it began making solar cells and modules at the factory in Buffalo, N.Y., in August 2017. The companies have said the factory's cells and modules would be used in Tesla solar products. Panasonic said it was now selling some of the plant's solar equipment to other customers, while Tesla is still buying some output as well.</p>
<p>Tesla said it was never obligated to buy the full output of the Buffalo plant, which it calls Gigafactory 2, and it continues to have a strong relationship with Panasonic.</p>
<p>"We continue to use cells and solar modules produced in Buffalo by Panasonic" in Tesla's solar products, a Tesla spokesman said. He said this was "in line with our contract, which contains no requirement of exclusivity." The spokesman added that "we anticipate using the full production capacity of Gigafactory 2 over time as we reach higher output and installation volumes."</p>
<p>The Buffalo factory is part of SolarCity, which Tesla acquired in 2016. Solar installations by the business have been slowing as Tesla retreats from riskier financing arrangements
 .</p>
<p>The solar business is one of many challenges on the plate of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who is facing an investigation by U.S. securities regulators
  over a tweet saying he had secured funding to take the electric-car maker private.</p>
<p>The solar business has taken a back seat as Tesla pushes to get production of its Model 3 vehicle up to speed. In early July, the company said it had achieved a long-delayed goal of assembling 5,000 of the sedans
  in about a week.</p>
<p>Panasonic's joint effort with Tesla in the solar business, first announced in 2016, builds on their cooperation for developing electric cars since Tesla's early days. The two companies jointly invested in the Gigafactory facility in Nevada, which supplies batteries for the Model 3.</p>
<p>Even though demand from Tesla has fallen short, Panasonic said overall demand for its U.S.-made solar-panel components remained intact because of tariffs the Trump administration placed on imported panels
  earlier this year. That has hit Chinese-made panels, which previously had a big share of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>The Osaka-based industrial and consumer-electronics conglomerate had said it planned to spend &yen;30 billion ($271 million) to beef up production lines at the Tesla-owned facility in Buffalo, and on Thursday it said the plan was unchanged.</p>
<p>Panasonic's solar business in its home market has been losing money after the Japanese government cut subsidies and demand for panels stagnated. Analysts said news that Panasonic couldn't rely on Tesla to buy all the Buffalo plant's output raised concerns over whether Panasonic could face similar problems in the U.S. Panasonic's shares fell 2.1% in Tokyo trading on Thursday after the Nikkei newspaper reported that Panasonic and Tesla revised a contract stipulating that the plant would exclusively supply Tesla. The companies said they didn't have such a contract.</p>

<p>The subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission seeks information from each of Tesla's directors, according to a person familiar with the matter. It isn't known what information is being sought.</p>
<p>Representatives for the SEC and Tesla declined to comment.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the SEC has made preliminary inquires about Mr. Musk's basis for writing on Twitter last week that he had "funding secured" for a deal.</p>
<p>The subpoena indicates senior SEC officials have authorized a formal investigation of the company, a step up from the initial inquiries the regulator made to Tesla last week. The SEC opens formal investigations when it thinks that a violation of law has occurred and that a probe is justified given the nature of the suspected misconduct and the potential harm to investors.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, companies and corporate officers can't give shareholders misleading information about meaningful company events.</p>
<p>SEC probes take months and sometimes years, and can be closed without legal action against a target if the SEC decides the evidence doesn't merit filing charges.</p>
<p>Fox Business Network earlier reported that Tesla received a subpoena from the SEC.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk surprised investors on Aug. 7 when he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share, or $72 billion, about 20% above the stock's trading price earlier that day. In his tweet, Mr. Musk said the buyout had "funding secured," without providing any details.</p>
<p>In a blog post on Tesla's website Monday, he clarified that discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund about funding the deal were the basis for his assertion, and said the fund hadn't signed off on a deal. The Saudi Public Investment Fund has a nearly 5% stake in Tesla.</p>
<p>Stephen Crimmins, a former SEC lawyer now at Murphy &amp; McGonigle PC, said the regulator probably needed to begin issuing subpoenas because the matter will involve asking questions of the Saudi fund.</p>
<p>"It's likely that in the Tesla matter the SEC staff needed to ask for a formal order of investigation to get subpoena power as a basis for relying on an international agreement between securities regulators to get help from the Saudis," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk also outlined an unorthodox setup for a potential deal, saying he expected a significant number of the company's current shareholders to hold on to their stakes in a take-private deal. He estimated about two-thirds of all shares owned by current investors would be rolled over into a private Tesla.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk and Tesla insiders own about 25% of Tesla, and individual investors hold a little more than 17% of the stock. The rest -- nearly 58% -- is held by big institutional investors, according to FactSet.</p>
<p>Two of those big shareholders disclosed in regulatory filings Tuesday that they pared their holdings in Tesla before the take-private conversations became public last week.</p>
<p>T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Fidelity Investments reduced their stakes by more than 20% in the quarter ended June 30, according to FactSet. T. Rowe sold 3.7 million shares and Fidelity sold 3.1 million shares.</p>
<p>The two investors still own more than 20 million shares combined, according to FactSet, and they remain two of Tesla's five largest institutional holders. It isn't known why they pared their stakes; representatives for the firms declined to comment.</p>
<p>Six of Tesla's other top 15 institutional shareholders also sold smaller stakes during the second quarter, according to FactSet. That included funds or accounts controlled by Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p>
<p>It isn't known how Mr. Musk would get around regulatory limits on the number of shareholders in a private company.</p>
<p>Companies with more than 500 "nonaccredited" investors -- individual investors below certain income and wealth thresholds -- are required to register their securities with the SEC. In addition, a public company can't go private and end its registration or filing obligations with the SEC if it has more than 300 shareholders.</p>
<p>The development shows how Mr. Musk's erratic behavior and seemingly unfiltered use of Twitter is a risk for Tesla, attracting unwanted drama as it tries to evolve into a more mainstream auto maker.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has repeatedly used Twitter to chide investors who are betting against his company, sometimes making boastful statements and offering positive outlooks that can boost the stock and hurt short sellers. He has also used Twitter to criticize regulators, scrutinize the media and debate people who target his business interests.</p>
<p>The investigation adds another distraction for Tesla as the company struggles to ramp up production of the Model 3, the sedan that Mr. Musk bets will bring electric cars to the masses. The company reached a long-delayed goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a week at the end of the second quarter.</p>

<p>The Model 3's profitability is a critical issue for the electric-car maker, which began selling the vehicle a year ago as it sought to move from a luxury niche into the mass market, and end years of losses.</p>
<p>The vehicle's price currently ranges from $49,000 to about $80,000, well above the more-affordable target long envisioned by Chief Executive Elon Musk.</p>
<p>At the low end of that range, Tesla's operating profit is likely $3,420 a vehicle, according to the UBS estimate, which is based on analysis of a Model 3 vehicle the firm deconstructed in order to understand how it was made. That would help explain why Mr. Musk is forecasting a profit in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The lack of a $35,000 base model in Tesla's lineup, as well as early demand for the more expensive versions, should set up the company for its best quarter of profitability from the vehicle ahead of less-costly versions down the road that will reduce the lineup's margins, Colin Langan, who wrote the UBS report, said Thursday in an interview.</p>
<p>"Q3 is Tesla's best shot because of this pricing dynamic," he said of profitability. "I'm very clear that I don't think that's sustainable."</p>
<p>A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Tesla's finances are in a brighter spotlight now as Mr. Musk considers taking the auto maker private, in part to shed intense scrutiny of the company's finances as it grows its business globally.</p>
<p>Before Tesla began Model 3 production in July 2017 and revealed its pricing strategy, UBS estimated the Model 3 at $35,000 would lose about $2,300 a car, while a more expensive version at $42,000 would eke out $670 of profit.</p>
<p>The teardown of the Model 3, however, resulted in a higher estimated cost of the vehicle's batteries.</p>
<p>Tesla has spent the past 12 months struggling to ramp up production to reach a rate that would give it enough vehicles to sell to generate cash. At the end of June, Tesla finally reached its long-delayed goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a single week, a pace that if continued should help it be profitable this quarter and next, Mr. Musk has said.</p>
<p>A $35,000 version will come later this year, Mr. Musk has promised. In May, on Twitter, he suggested Tesla first needed to ramp up production to help lower costs, saying shipping the $35,000 version then would cause the company "to lose money &amp; die."</p>
<p>Tesla needs three to six months after being able to reach a build rate of 5,000 sedans a week before being able to sell the $35,000 version and "live," he said.</p>
<p>The challenge for the auto industry in selling electric vehicles is the added cost of batteries compared to a gasoline powered vehicle.</p>

<p>Securities regulators last year subpoenaed a parts supplier for Tesla Inc. as they looked at whether the auto maker misled investors about Model 3 car production problems, indicating the company was under investigation before Elon Musk tweeted he might take the company private
 , according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission's probe of Tesla's disclosures about Model 3 production preceded its latest demand for information related to Mr. Musk's tweets, the person said. Regulators have also subpoenaed Tesla's directors seeking to learn what they knew about Mr. Musk's plan to take Tesla private, according to another person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Both issues are being handled by the SEC's San Francisco office, one of the people said.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported in October that the Tesla assembly plant's body shop wasn't fully installed until around September and that major portions of the Model 3 were being hand built weeks after Mr. Musk announced production had begun in July 2017. As production started, he claimed about 1,600 cars would be made in the third quarter of 2017 before reaching 20,000 in December. Those forecasts were far below what he predicted roughly a year earlier, when he said as many 200,000 Model 3s would be made in the second half of 2017.</p>
<p>Instead, Tesla made 2,700 Model 3s during 2017. The sedan, priced to start at $35,000, is designed to propel the luxury electric-car maker into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Under U.S. securities law, Tesla and its executives could face sanctions if regulators determine they misled investors about the cause or extent of production delays. SEC probes can last months or even years, and sometimes end without the regulator charging a target with wrongdoing.</p>
<p>An SEC spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Brad Bennett, a lawyer at Baker Botts LLP, said the SEC has brought enforcement actions in the past against companies over operational projections. They are hard claims to prove, he said, because they require digging into the details of what a company is building.</p>
<p>"You would have to prove the speaker didn't believe those things, or there was no rational basis for it," said Mr. Bennett, who was formerly director of enforcement for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Musk's hope to take Tesla private, regulators are pressing Tesla's directors
  to reveal how much information Mr. Musk shared with them before he tweeted about it last week.</p>
<p>The SEC is investigating whether Mr. Musk intentionally misled investors when he tweeted about the proposal in a bid to hurt short sellers by driving up Tesla's stock price, the person said.</p>
<p>Establishing what the board knew and when is key to the SEC's probe. For instance, if Mr. Musk didn't show the board a relatively firm deal with potential investors, it could indicate that the conversations weren't as far along as he suggested when he tweeted that he had "funding secured" for a deal.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk surprised investors on Aug. 7 when he tweeted that he was considering taking the electric-car maker private at $420 a share, or $72 billion. Tesla shares surged on the news. The next day, Tesla's independent directors said Mr. Musk had informed them about the proposal
  the prior week.</p>
<p>In a blog post on Tesla's website Monday, Mr. Musk clarified that discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund about financing the deal were the basis for his assertion
 . He said the fund hadn't signed off on a deal.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk often wields his Twitter account as a weapon against short sellers
 , or those who bet that Tesla's stock price will go down, and he has said going private would end "negative propaganda" from investors betting against Tesla. On June 17, Mr. Musk tweeted that short sellers "have about three weeks before their short position explodes."</p>
<p>A person who intentionally misleads shareholders can be charged with fraud under U.S. securities laws. If Mr. Musk can show he had a basis to make the statement--such as advanced talks with the Saudi fund or a promise from them to fund the deal--regulators would be less likely to allege that his statement was misleading or false.</p>
<p>Tesla already faces private litigation in a San Francisco federal court, where a group of investors alleged the company mislead investors about how quickly it could ramp up Model 3 production. Tesla has argued for the class-action lawsuit to be dismissed, saying it disclosed production problems in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Tesla produced more than 5,000 Model 3s during the last week of June, the company said in a filing issued on Aug. 6. The company said it hopes to achieve 10,000 vehicles a week "by sometime in 2019."</p>
<p>To go private, Mr. Musk would have to pare back the number of Tesla stockholders. Firms with over 2,000 shareholders--or more than 500 retail investors who don't meet certain wealth and income thresholds--are required to report results quarterly and provide detailed risk disclosures.</p>
<p>But Mr. Musk outlined an unorthodox setup for a potential deal, saying he expected a significant number of the company's shareholders would remain after Tesla became a private firm. He estimated about two-thirds of all shares owned by current investors would be rolled over into a private Tesla.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk and Tesla insiders own about 25% of Tesla, and individual investors hold a little more than 17% of the stock. The rest--nearly 58%--is held by big institutional investors, according to FactSet.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed a parts supplier for the auto maker as part of the probe, one of the people said, well before the regulators began looking into Elon Musk's tweet last week about taking the company private.</p>
<p>Regulators have also subpoenaed Tesla's directors seeking to learn what they knew about Mr. Musk's plan to take Tesla private, according to another person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Both issues are being handled by the SEC's San Francisco office, one of the people said.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported in October that the Tesla assembly plant's body shop wasn't fully installed until around September and that major portions of the Model 3 were being hand built weeks after Mr. Musk announced production had begun in July 2017. As production started, he claimed about 1,600 cars would be made in the third quarter of 2017 before reaching 20,000 in December. Those forecasts were far below what he predicted roughly a year earlier, when he said as many 200,000 Model 3s would be made in the second half of 2017.</p>
<p>Instead, Tesla made 2,700 Model 3s during 2017. The sedan, priced to start at $35,000, is designed to propel the luxury electric-car maker into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Under U.S. securities law, Tesla and its executives could face sanctions if regulators determine they misled investors about the cause or extent of production delays. SEC probes can last months or even years, and sometimes end without the regulator charging a target with wrongdoing.</p>
<p>An SEC spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Brad Bennett, a lawyer at Baker Botts LLP, said the SEC has brought enforcement actions in the past against companies over operational projections. They are hard claims to prove, he said, because they require digging into the details of what a company is building.</p>
<p>"You would have to prove the speaker didn't believe those things, or there was no rational basis for it," said Mr. Bennett, who was formerly director of enforcement for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</p>
<p>Tesla already faces private litigation in a San Francisco federal court, where a group of investors alleged the company misled investors about how quickly it could ramp up Model 3 production. Tesla has argued for the class-action lawsuit to be dismissed, saying it disclosed production problems in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Musk's hope to take Tesla private, regulators are pressing Tesla's directors to reveal how much information Mr. Musk shared with them before he tweeted about it last week.</p>
<p>The SEC is investigating whether Mr. Musk intentionally misled investors when he tweeted about the proposal in a bid to hurt short sellers by driving up Tesla's stock price, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Establishing what the board knew and when is key to the SEC's probe. For instance, if Mr. Musk didn't show the board a relatively firm deal with potential investors, it could indicate that the conversations weren't as far along as he suggested when he tweeted that he had "funding secured" for a deal.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk surprised investors on Aug. 7 when he tweeted that he was considering taking the electric-car maker private at $420 a share, or $72 billion. Tesla shares surged on the news. The next day, Tesla's independent directors said Mr. Musk had informed them about the proposal the prior week.</p>
<p>In a blog post on Tesla's website Monday, Mr. Musk clarified that discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund about financing the deal were the basis for his assertion. He said the fund hadn't signed off on a deal.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk often wields his Twitter account as a weapon against short sellers, or those who bet that Tesla's stock price will go down, and he has said going private would end "negative propaganda" from investors betting against Tesla. On June 17, Mr. Musk tweeted that short sellers "have about three weeks before their short position explodes."</p>
<p>A person who intentionally misleads shareholders can be charged with fraud under U.S. securities laws. If Mr. Musk can show he had a basis to make the statement -- such as advanced talks with the Saudi fund or a promise from them to fund the deal -- regulators would be less likely to allege that his statement was misleading or false.</p>
<p>To go private, Mr. Musk would have to pare back the number of Tesla stockholders. Firms with over 2,000 shareholders -- or more than 500 retail investors who don't meet certain wealth and income thresholds -- are required to report results quarterly and provide detailed risk disclosures.</p>
<p>But Mr. Musk outlined an unorthodox setup for a potential deal, saying he expected a significant number of the company's shareholders would remain after Tesla became a private firm. He estimated about two-thirds of all shares owned by current investors would be rolled over into a private Tesla.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk and Tesla insiders own about 25% of Tesla, and individual investors hold a little more than 17% of the stock. The rest -- nearly 58% -- is held by big institutional investors, according to FactSet.</p>

  finances. That is no longer possible.</p>
<p>Tesla is in trouble after a chaotic week. Elon Musk's supposed plan
  to take the company private at $420 a share looks more like a fantasy. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating
  the company on multiple fronts, including issues related to disclosure about production of the Model 3 sedan. Shares dove 8% Friday morning.</p>
<p>The SEC investigation is a threat to investors, albeit not in the way one might expect. Whatever fine might come if Tesla was found to violate regulations would have minimal impact. The most important impact is Tesla may struggle to raise the cash it badly needs while the investigation is going on. Few investors will buy new shares in a company under investigation. Those who would will likely demand tough terms, which would come at the expense of current investors.</p>
<p>These investigations can take time, and a look at Tesla's balance sheet suggests there isn't much time to spare. The company had $2.2 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, but it burned through $1.8 billion of cash in the first half of the year. Accounts payable, meanwhile, topped $3 billion. Tesla has more than $10 billion in total debt and $23 billion in total liabilities, and has never generated profits over a full year. Moody's Investors Service warned back in March that Tesla needs to raise $2 billion of capital in the "near term."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has disputed the idea that Tesla needs to raise money, in part because profits are right around the corner. He claimed on the second-quarter earnings call earlier this month that Tesla will generate profits and cash flow in the third quarter, but executives demurred when an analyst asked if Tesla turned a profit in July. The company didn't immediately respond to a question on whether Tesla made money in the quarter through Thursday.</p>
<p>Like many fast-growing companies in capital-intensive businesses, Tesla (and its investors) bet that it would generate profits and cash before its debt became unsustainable. That explains the urgency around production of the Model 3. The SEC investigation upends that strategy.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has long-threatened to squeeze investors betting against Tesla's stock. There is a squeeze coming, but it isn't what Mr. Musk predicted.</p>

<p>Tesla Inc. backed off an agreement to buy all the output from a solar-panel factory it operates with Panasonic Corp. An earlier version of this article misspelled Tesla's name in the headline as Telsa. (Aug. 16, 2018)</p>
<p>TOKYO--Tesla Inc. has backed away from an agreement to buy all of the output from a solar-panel factory it operates
  with Panasonic Corp., the Japanese company said Thursday, another sign of the uncertain outlook for Tesla's SolarCity subsidiary.</p>
<p>Panasonic said it began making solar cells and modules at the factory in Buffalo, N.Y., in August 2017, under a deal that called for Tesla to buy the entire output for its home solar-panel business. But Panasonic said the deal was revised early this year, and since then it has been selling some of the production to other panel makers. Tesla is still buying some modules and cells from the plant as well.</p>
<p>Tesla said it was never obligated to buy the full output of the Buffalo plant, which it calls Gigafactory 2, and it continues to have a strong relationship with Panasonic.</p>
<p>"We continue to use cells and solar modules produced in Buffalo by Panasonic" in Tesla's solar products, a Tesla spokesman said. He said this was "in line with our contract, which contains no requirement of exclusivity." The spokesman added that "we anticipate using the full production capacity of Gigafactory 2 over time as we reach higher output and installation volumes."</p>
<p>The Buffalo factory is part of SolarCity, which Tesla acquired in 2016. Solar installations by the business have been slowing as Tesla retreats from riskier financing arrangements
 .</p>
<p>The solar business is one of many challenges on the plate of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who is facing an investigation by U.S. securities regulators
  over a tweet saying he had secured funding to take the electric-car maker private.</p>
<p>The solar business has taken a back seat as Tesla pushes to get production of its Model 3 vehicle up to speed. In early July, the company said it had achieved a long-delayed goal of assembling 5,000 of the sedans
  in about a week.</p>
<p>Panasonic's joint effort with Tesla in the solar business, first announced in 2016, builds on their cooperation for developing electric cars since Tesla's early days. The two companies jointly invested in the Gigafactory facility in Nevada, which supplies batteries for the Model 3.</p>
<p>Even though demand from Tesla has fallen short, Panasonic said overall demand for its U.S.-made solar-panel components remained intact because of tariffs the Trump administration placed on imported panels
  earlier this year. That has hit Chinese-made panels, which previously had a big share of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>The Osaka-based industrial and consumer-electronics conglomerate had said it planned to spend &yen;30 billion ($271 million) to beef up production lines at the Tesla-owned facility in Buffalo, and on Thursday it said the plan was unchanged.</p>
<p>Panasonic's solar business in its home market has been losing money after the Japanese government cut subsidies and demand for panels stagnated. Analysts said the contract change with Tesla raised concerns over whether Panasonic could face similar problems in the U.S. Panasonic's shares fell 2.1% in Tokyo trading on Thursday after the Nikkei newspaper reported on the contract revision.</p>

Stock movements reflect premarket trading.</p>
<p>Apple Inc.--Up 0.2%: Under fire from Chinese state media, Apple said it removed illegal gambling apps
  from its App Store in China--a move that could help quell the latest challenge for the American tech giant in its most important market outside of the U.S. Apple shares rose every day last week, including a 2% climb Friday, and the stock has fallen just twice this month.</p>
<p>PepsiCo Inc.--Up 0.3%: PepsiCo agreed to buy
  SodaStream International Ltd. for $3.2 billion. It's the latest move by the cola giant to diversify away from sugary sodas and salty snacks. SodaStream shares are up 10%.</p>
<p>Sears Holdings Corp.--Down 3.4%: Sears CEO Edward Lampert for years has called the shots as its chief executive, largest shareholder and biggest lender. But his latest play to keep the struggling chain afloat is out of his hands.
</p>
<p>Tesla Inc.--Down 6.1%: JP Morgan analysts cut the firm's price target for Telsa, saying that CEO Elon Musk's claim to have funding secured to take the company private
  was likely not the case.</p>
<p>Nike Inc.--Up 2.3%: Susquehanna analysts raised the athletic footwear company to buy, saying the company is gaining share from Adidas and others as it improves its product offerings. Piper Jaffray analysts also upgraded the stock to overweight.</p>
<p>Est&eacute;e Lauder Companies Inc.--Up 4%: The cosmetics company beat earnings and revenue expectations for its fourth fiscal quarter, reporting growth in brands including its namesake Est&eacute;e Lauder and La Mer skin care.</p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories--Up 0.4%: The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street writes that the company is growing its top line
  faster than just about any health-care company of comparable size and since it doesn't sell pharmaceuticals in the U.S., it is relatively insulated from regulatory risk.</p>
<p>Tyson Foods Inc.--Down 0.2%: Tyson has agreed to buy Keystone Foods, a major supplier of chicken nuggets to McDonald's Corp. and other companies, for $2.16 billion
  as part of its strategy to bolster its protein offerings and expand globally.</p>

<p>A recent survey sent privately by a well-regarded automotive supplier association to top executives found that 18 of 22 respondents believe that Tesla is now a financial risk to their companies, according to the document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Separately, several suppliers in interviews said Tesla has tried to stretch out payments or asked for significant cash back. And in some cases, public records show, small suppliers over the past several months have claimed they failed to get paid for services supplied to Tesla.</p>
<p>Tesla has improved its on-time payments to production-related suppliers to about 95% from 90% last year, according to people familiar with the matter. For nonproduction suppliers, Tesla is paying on time about 80% of the time, the people said.</p>
<p>"We're not behind because we can't pay them," Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in an interview Friday. "It is just because we're arguing whether the parts are right."</p>
<p>The suppliers collectively represent a sliver of the hundreds of vendors that provide Tesla with components, tooling of manufacturing parts and services such as building construction. But taken together, the survey, interviews and documents show some suppliers are anxious about Tesla's ability to pay them back.</p>
<p>"Regarding Tesla, any time there is uncertainty in the marketplace, it causes concerns for suppliers," said Julie Fream, the chief executive of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, which sent the survey in the past few weeks--a period that encompassed Tesla's second-quarter earnings and Mr. Musk's announcement on Twitter
  that Tesla had secured funding for a plan to go private
 . "The current dialogue about Tesla 'going private,' the well-publicized Model 3 manufacturing ramp-up challenges, as well as recently reported contentious purchasing tactics raise concerns for our members."</p>
<p>The survey was sent to members of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association's council, which is made up of lead North American sales executives representing about 100 suppliers. It isn't known how many exactly were surveyed. Of the 35 that responded, 23 were current or past Tesla suppliers. Some respondents didn't answer all questions.</p>
<p>In the interview, Mr. Musk and financial chief Deepak Ahuja said Tesla's financial strength is improving and it remains on track to be cash-flow positive and profitable in the current quarter. They said relations with its suppliers are good.</p>
<p>"If there was any doubt in our suppliers in the first place that should definitely be strongly extinguished, with our commentary and our results and the ramp-up of our production," Mr. Ahuja said.</p>
<p>All of the respondents to the survey said they wanted to sustain or grow their business with the auto maker, and none wanted to exit.</p>
<p>Delays this year in the production of the Model 3 car drained Tesla's cash, which fell by $1.13 billion in the first six months of the year
  to $2.24 billion.</p>
<p>Tesla's current cash picture looks similar, according to internal company records reviewed by the Journal and to people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>Tesla's cash and cash equivalents fell to $1.69 billion as of Aug. 12, according to the records. That was largely because it repaid $500 million of a revolving credit line in July. Tesla plans to tap that same amount again later this quarter, according to the records. That, plus additional cash flow that Tesla anticipates from an increase in vehicle deliveries in the second half of the quarter, is expected to leave it with several hundred million dollars more in cash at the end of September compared with three months earlier, according to the records.</p>
<p>To conserve cash, Tesla has asked some of its capital-equipment suppliers in recent weeks for cash back
  ranging from 9% to 20% of what the company paid dating back to 2016, according to people familiar with the requests. In one email to a supplier reviewed by the Journal, Tesla asked for help to make "an immediate impact" by providing a rebate on products already purchased.</p>
<p>Tesla has said the rebates applied to less than 10 capital-equipment suppliers. Mr. Ahuja stressed that production-related suppliers--those it depends on to keep cars coming off the assembly line--weren't asked for rebates, but instead Tesla is seeking to get costs reduced on future work.</p>
<p>The recent Original Equipment Suppliers Association survey found that 13 of 23 respondents said Tesla requested a "large" price reduction on current business and/or retroactive rebates.</p>
<p>One parts supplier was asked by Tesla for a 10% reduction on costs across the board going forward, a person familiar with the matter said in an interview. This person said the request was extreme, saying other auto makers typically seek savings of 1% to 2% on individual parts or programs.</p>
<p>The supplier said Tesla indicated it would ask to extend the payment terms to 120 days from 60 days if it didn't get the price reduction, a length rarer among auto makers than a 90-day term.</p>
<p>Eleven of 23 responding suppliers in the survey said Tesla had asked them to extend payment terms. One tooling supplier was asked in recent weeks to move to a 90-day payment schedule from 60 days, according to a review of a proposed contract and a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Ahuja said it is normal for auto makers to ask for better terms as the business improves. Tesla has steadily lengthened its payment terms over the past few years, and more U.S. public companies are extending the amount of time they take to pay their bills
 .</p>
<p>One of the suppliers said Tesla has stopped making payments to the company since last spring despite numerous promises. This person said he fears insolvency for his own company if he continues to ship products to Tesla and not get paid.</p>
<p>Public records show 16 companies since October have taken the unusual step of filing mechanic's liens--or legal claims seeking unpaid compensation--against Tesla claiming bills haven't been paid for supplies and services. Previously, only four liens had been filed against Tesla in all of 2015 and 2016 combined.</p>
<p>The liens were mostly filed this year in Alameda County, Calif., by small subcontractors against Tesla and contractors of the auto maker, primarily for providing work at the company's Fremont factory. Some of the suppliers have since been paid, and the total outstanding dollar amount of claims is relatively small, totaling nearly $8 million, according to the documents.</p>
<p>Liens filed by suppliers against auto makers are rare, say automotive industry specialists. "When a customer is having financial issues...suppliers start filing liens to protect their secured position to ensure they are paid," said Dan Sharkey, a lawyer at Brooks, Wilkins, Sharkey &amp; Turco PLLC who specializes in supply-chain issues.</p>
<p>Mr. Ahuja, Tesla's CFO, said it would be wrong to see the liens by subcontractors as a sign of financial distress. "It is an issue between the subcontractor and contractor," he said, adding that it is common practice for subcontractors to name the manufacturer in a lien to create pressure on it.</p>
<p>Tesla shares rose 1% to $308.44. Earlier Monday, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. slashed its stock-price target for Tesla to $195 from $308.</p>
<p>The Original Equipment Suppliers Association survey also found that eight of 22 respondents said they are worried about the auto maker filing for bankruptcy. It was conducted between July 26 and Aug. 8, the day after Mr. Musk tweeted about a plan to go private. He has since revealed a deal is far from complete.</p>
<p>In an email on Friday to the Journal, Mr. Musk said, "We are definitely not going bankrupt."</p>

<p>It has sparked a secular decline in public listings. It has led a prominent CEO to recently declare his intention to consider taking his company private. It could also result in a loosening of rules around what is required of public companies.</p>
<p>On Friday, President Trump said he instructed the Securities and Exchange Commission to study whether companies should release earnings twice a year, rather than four times. He tweeted that business leaders told him it "would allow greater flexibility &amp; save money."</p>
<p>Such a practice, while potentially helping companies to move away from short-term profit goals, would also limit investors' visibility into corporate performance, a move that echoes the more-limited transparency among private companies.</p>
<p>It is a clear sign that for public-trading venues, private markets have grown to be tougher competition. Ample venture funding and low rates have left companies with myriad options for raising capital without going through an increasingly expensive initial-public-offering process and adhering to stringent listing requirements.</p>
<p>There are now fewer public U.S. companies than in 1976, even though gross domestic product has grown sharply over the four-decade-plus period, according to a report from investment bank Credit Suisse last year.</p>
<p>The public markets could lose one of its higher-profile members if Tesla Inc. chief Elon Musk gets his way and completes a take-private deal. Though the outcome of that effort is uncertain, Mr. Musk indicated in a memo last week that his thinking is influenced by a grass-is-greener view of private markets.</p>
<p>"Basically, I'm trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible," he wrote.</p>
<p>Given this backdrop, it isn't surprising that politicians want to reshape the financial markets. When a company leaves the public markets, it gets that much harder for the average investor to take part in that company's growth.</p>
<p>And it's not just Mr. Trump. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren recently proposed that large companies be required to consider the interests of all stakeholders, including workers.</p>
<p>The stock market is slowly transforming itself. Everyday investors should hope these changes don't reduce the transparency and access that public shareholders have historically enjoyed.</p>

<p>A recent survey sent privately by a well-regarded automotive supplier association to top executives found that 18 of 22 respondents believe that Tesla is now a financial risk to their companies, according to the document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Separately, several suppliers in interviews said Tesla has tried to stretch out payments or asked for significant cash back. And in some cases, public records show, small suppliers over the past several months have claimed they failed to get paid for services supplied to Tesla.</p>
<p>Tesla has improved its on-time payments to production-related suppliers to about 95% from 90% last year, according to people familiar with the matter. For nonproduction suppliers, Tesla is paying on time about 80% of the time, the people said.</p>
<p>"We're not behind because we can't pay them," Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in an interview Friday. "It is just because we're arguing whether the parts are right."</p>
<p>The suppliers collectively represent a sliver of the hundreds of vendors that provide Tesla with components, tooling of manufacturing parts and services such as building construction. Taken together, the survey, interviews and documents show some suppliers are anxious about Tesla's ability to pay them back.</p>
<p>"Regarding Tesla, any time there is uncertainty in the marketplace, it causes concerns for suppliers," said Julie Fream, the chief executive of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, which sent the survey in the past few weeks -- a period that encompassed Tesla's second-quarter earnings and Mr. Musk's announcement on Twitter that Tesla had secured funding for a plan to go private.</p>
<p>The survey was sent to members of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association's council, which is made up of lead North American sales executives representing about 100 suppliers. It isn't known how many exactly were surveyed. Of the 35 that responded, 23 were current or past Tesla suppliers. Some respondents didn't answer all questions.</p>
<p>In the interview, Mr. Musk and financial chief Deepak Ahuja said Tesla's financial strength is improving and it remains on track to be cash-flow positive and profitable in the current quarter. They said relations with its suppliers are good.</p>
<p>"If there was any doubt in our suppliers in the first place that should definitely be strongly extinguished, with our commentary and our results and the ramp-up of our production," Mr. Ahuja said.</p>
<p>All of the respondents to the survey said they wanted to sustain or grow their business with the auto maker, and none wanted to exit.</p>
<p>Delays in the production of the Model 3 drained Tesla's cash, which fell by $1.13 billion in the first six months of the year to $2.24 billion.</p>
<p>Tesla's current cash picture looks similar, according to company records reviewed by the Journal and to people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>Tesla's cash and cash equivalents fell to $1.69 billion as of Aug. 12, according to the records. That was largely because it repaid $500 million of a revolving credit line in July. Tesla plans to tap that same amount again later this quarter, according to the records. That, plus additional cash flow that Tesla anticipates from an increase in vehicle deliveries in the second half of the quarter, is expected to leave it with several hundred million dollars more in cash at the end of September compared with three months earlier, according to the records.</p>
<p>To conserve cash, Tesla has asked some of its capital-equipment suppliers in recent weeks for cash back ranging from 9% to 20% of what the company paid dating back to 2016, according to people familiar with the requests. In one email to a supplier reviewed by the Journal, Tesla asked for help to make "an immediate impact" by providing a rebate on products already purchased.</p>
<p>Tesla has said the rebates applied to less than 10 capital-equipment suppliers. Mr. Ahuja stressed that production-related suppliers -- those it depends on to keep cars coming off the assembly line -- weren't asked for rebates, but instead Tesla is seeking to get costs reduced on future work.</p>
<p>Eleven of 23 responding suppliers in the survey said Tesla had asked them to extend payment terms.</p>
<p>Mr. Ahuja said it is normal for auto makers to ask for better terms as the business improves.</p>
<p>Public records show 16 companies since October have taken the unusual step of filing mechanic's liens -- or legal claims seeking unpaid compensation -- against Tesla claiming bills haven't been paid for supplies and services. Previously, only four liens had been filed against Tesla in all of 2015 and 2016 combined.</p>
<p>The liens were mostly filed this year in Alameda County, Calif., by small subcontractors against Tesla and contractors of the auto maker, primarily for providing work at the company's Fremont factory. Some of the suppliers have since been paid, and the total outstanding dollar amount of claims is relatively small, totaling nearly $8 million, according to the documents.</p>
<p>Liens filed by suppliers against auto makers are rare, say industry specialists.</p>
<p>Mr. Ahuja, Tesla's CFO, said it would be wrong to see the liens by subcontractors as a sign of financial distress. "It is an issue between the subcontractor and contractor," he said, adding that it is common practice for subcontractors to name the manufacturer in a lien to create pressure on it.</p>
<p>In an email on Friday to the Journal, Mr. Musk said, "We are definitely not going bankrupt."</p>

<p>Tesla said the fire wasn't near the outdoor tent it erected this year to expand vehicle assembly as it raced to increase output of its Model 3 sedan, and the company said the fire won't affect production.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Elon Musk said it started in a pile of cardboard being prepped for recycling, and he praised the rapid response of local firefighters. "No injuries or damage to factory," said a post on his Twitter account.</p>
<p>It was the latest of several fires over the past year in or outside the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., and resembled one two months ago that Tesla said at the time had hit a structure housing cardboard and recyclable material outside the factory.</p>
<p>Tesla and the Fremont Fire Dept. said they are investigating the cause of the latest blaze.</p>
<p>The incident came at a sensitive time for Tesla, after Mr. Musk shocked investors and observers earlier this month with a tweet saying he wanted to take the Silicon Valley car maker private at a price that would value it above $70 billion. U.S. securities regulators are investigating Mr. Musk's disclosure about the plan and his claim to have secured funding for a deal, which his subsequent comments showed wasn't accurate. Mr. Musk has hired advisers but has yet to make public any formal proposal.</p>

<p>Back then the company was on solid financial footing and generating healthy growth selling its high-end electric cars to devoted customers. The two moves by Mr. Musk changed the direction of Tesla, leading directly to its growing financial distress and to the investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission
 .</p>
<p>Despite all of his recent public statements, Mr. Musk does not appear to have learned from these mistakes. With investors still valuing Tesla as if its only trouble is keeping up with insatiable demand, the risk to the stock is very high.</p>
<p>At the start of 2016, the stock market was tumbling. Shares of Tesla were down and shares of Mr. Musk's other public company, SolarCity, were down even more. SolarCity, like its competitors that sold solar panels to homeowners, was in severe financial straits.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk tried to reverse the declines. He unveiled the mass-market Model 3, which was supposed to sell for $35,000, potentially expanding the company's market exponentially. Later, even before the Model 3 design was complete, he called the car "the biggest consumer product launch ever." On a conference call with analysts that day, Mr. Musk said he expected that Tesla would make 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s in the second half of 2017. Tesla's shares nearly doubled in the next year. That number turned out to be about 4,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's other fateful decision that year was to merge SolarCity into Tesla.</p>
<p>That move quelled worries about SolarCity filing for bankruptcy, but saddled Tesla with another unprofitable business and stuffed $3 billion in extra debt onto its balance sheet. To sell investors on the deal, Mr. Musk pitched product ideas that have yet to result in meaningful revenue.</p>
<p>At Tesla, Mr. Musk's promises forced the company to borrow an additional $1.8 billion and rush to boost production of the Model 3, which proved costly. After initial struggles, sales have grown rapidly but costs have risen even faster. The operating leverage--increasing profit margins on each extra dollar of revenue--that Tesla needs remains elusive.</p>
<p>Tesla is under increasing pressure to generate cash after burning through $1.8 billion in the first six months of this year. The company has about $1.3 billion in convertible debt due in November and March. It had $3 billion in accounts payable and just $2.2 billion in cash on hand as of June 30. Including capitalized leases, long-term debt tops $11 billion, according to FactSet.</p>
<p>Tesla's suppliers are starting to worry about being paid
  what they're owed. Mr. Musk grew so frustrated about the scrutiny his projections have received that he tweeted he had a deal in place to take Tesla private. That tweet and Mr. Musk's optimistic projections for the Model 3 are under scrutiny by the SEC. Soon after he felt the need to email that Tesla was not going bankrupt.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk may have believed that letting SolarCity fail would dent the reputation he built at PayPal and his rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies. That could have hurt all of his businesses, including Tesla, which was regularly selling stock to fund its growth.</p>
<p>Tesla has several options to get out of its current jam. It could scale back production plans for the Model 3 to the point that it could produce them profitably. Tesla says it will turn a profit this quarter but given its history of overly optimistic forecasts, even persistently bullish analysts are skeptical, predicting it will lose $1.19 a share. But a profit is possible, largely because Model 3s are selling for $50,000 and more rather than the promised $35,000. A financial option, assuming the SEC lets it, would be to sell stock, but Tesla has repeatedly said it has no plans to do so.</p>
<p>Another riskier option is to persuade holders of the $1.3 billion in convertible debt who are due to be paid back in the coming months, to accept stock in Tesla instead of cash, according to Vicki Bryan, founder of research firm Bond Angle. She forecasts that move would minimize the dilution suffered by current investors while significantly reducing near-term debt, and give Tesla an extra six- to seven-month window to preserve its cash.</p>
<p>Whatever Tesla chooses to do, Mr. Musk needs to show that there has been a lesson learned. If not, investors should be skeptical of any plan he offers.</p>

He failed to offer counsel on the one subject about which he is uniquely qualified to speak: how to best the Securities and Exchange Commission in a legal battle.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuban, who ended up beating the agency in a jury trial, was happy to spell out one piece of advice at a Texas law-school forum back in 2014: "If you've got resources, fight 'em," he said of the SEC, "because they're not that smart."</p>
<p>The two cases are perhaps less different than they seem. Mr. Cuban was accused of insider trading. As a shareholder in the inauspicious search site Mamma.com, he had gotten a heads-up from the CEO about a forthcoming transaction on unattractive terms. He dumped his stock, avoiding what the SEC said was $750,000 in losses.</p>
<p>A question for Mr. Cuban won't be a question for Mr. Musk: whether he owes a fiduciary duty to fellow shareholders. As CEO, Mr. Musk surely does. Arguably he violated that duty when he tweeted that he had "secured" funding for a Tesla buyout when he hadn't.</p>
<p>Beyond this, though, both cases involve definitions and rationales precious to the SEC that are less bright line-y than the agency likes to think, and that it has been loath to risk putting in front of a jury. These include, in Mr. Musk's situation, whether the often flippant tweets of a Twitter-happy CEO should be considered "material" by shareholders--especially after a long run of dubious Musk tweets and statements that haven't brought discipline from the SEC.</p>
<p>Also, neither defendant is a dentist from Larchmont; they are celebrity businessmen with deep pockets plus a reservoir of public goodwill. And both prosecutions feature an unfortunate dependence on foreign witnesses who can't be compelled to testify. Mamma.com's Canadian CEO declined to appear at Mr. Cuban's trial, though he did submit to a video deposition, which the jury apparently found uncompelling next to testimony from Mr. Cuban in the flesh.</p>
<p>In Mr. Musk's case, the government would likely seek the testimony of Saudi Arabia's national sovereign wealth fund, which had discussed a buyout with Mr. Musk. Here's guessing that high-ranking Saudi officials don't give a flock about the SEC's investigation and wouldn't wish to participate in a prosecution of Mr. Musk.</p>
<p>To some who believe in the importance of the SEC's mission against insider trading, Mr. Cuban's acquittal was an example of jury nullification--jurors simply refusing to enforce the law against a celebrity defendant.</p>
<p>Equally salient for Mr. Musk's lawyers, though, is the nine years that elapsed between Mr. Cuban's 2004 stock sale and his 2013 acquittal. Nine years is likely to resolve outstanding questions about Tesla. If you are the SEC, stringing up Mr. Musk would have a lot more appeal if there are angry shareholders to assuage than if Mr. Musk is being hailed as this century's Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the pressing question of cash. Some believe a Tesla meltdown is a fait accompli because the equity markets won't supply needed money while an investigation hangs over the company.</p>
<p>The premise is doubtful and Tesla should test it. Mr. Musk recently hired the folks at Goldman Sachs to advise on his pie-in-the-sky going-private transaction. They would be better employed beating the shrubbery for credible new investors to provide a couple billion to see the company through its time of troubles.</p>
<p>The Saudis are a place to start. Warren Buffett has performed such services in the past for companies under a cloud. Google and Apple are obvious candidates. The auto industry features big players who might make an investment and call it a strategic partnership.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's bailout of his related company Solar City two years ago with Tesla shareholder money showed that he understands just how much Tesla's share price rests on his magical reputation as an unfailing capitalist genius. Now is a dangerous moment for the Musk bubble. As Elon himself seems to have understood earlier than others, the bubble is fraying and Tesla needs to scale back its ambitions to make and sell a car that can be sold at a profit, which the mass-market, $35,000 version of the Model 3 isn't.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk appears to have convinced himself that this must be done without raising fresh capital. When the facts change, smart people change their minds. Right now, nothing would serve Tesla better than finding big-time investors who believe that such a transition is achievable, who aren't put off by the SEC, and who are wiling to stump up money to help it happen.</p>

Chief Executive Elon Musk said late Friday that he is giving up on taking the company private in the wake of shareholders' objections, 17 days after he shocked the business world
  with a tweet announcing intentions to pursue the idea.</p>
<p>In a post on the company's website, Mr. Musk said he had informed Tesla's board Thursday that "I believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public." Tesla directors around the same time Friday night released a statement saying "we fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk said he made the decision to remain public after consulting Tesla shareholders large and small, and after concluding that the undertaking could impair efforts to boost production of its new sedan that are crucial to his strategy for Tesla.</p>
<p>"I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it's clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated," Mr. Musk wrote. "This is a problem because we absolutely must stay focused on ramping Model 3 and becoming profitable."</p>
<p>The timing of Mr. Musk's announcement ending the go-private effort--after 8 p.m. Pacific time on a Friday night, a day after the decision was discussed with the board--echoed the surprise of his initial tweet on Aug. 7.</p>
<p>The stunning reversal follows intense scrutiny of Mr. Musk's plan
 , which would have valued Tesla at $420 a share, or more than $70 billion, and how he formulated and disclosed it to investors
  with an initial claim to have secured funding for such a transaction. Mr. Musk's subsequent comments made clear that no final deal for financing was in place.</p>
<p>In the days after his Aug. 7 announcement, Mr. Musk and the Silicon Valley auto maker's board of directors raced to assemble teams of financial advisers
  and lawyers to help facilitate complex negotiations. The directors last week created a special committee to consider his proposal.</p>
<p>The board statement Friday night, signed by Tesla's six currently active independent directors, said it had disbanded the committee.</p>
<p>"The Board and the entire company remain focused on ensuring Tesla's operational success," the statement said.</p>
<p>Tesla has struggled
  for the past year to speed up Model 3 production, placing Mr. Musk under intense scrutiny and raising questions about the company's finances. The sedan is intended to be Tesla's first midprice vehicle, aimed at transforming the Silicon Valley company from a niche, luxury brand into a mass-market car maker.</p>
<p>Tesla now is trying to keep up the pace of manufacturing more than 5,000 of the sedans a week this quarter to generate cash and turn a profit. Its cash dwindled in the second quarter, and some of its suppliers have voiced concern about the auto maker's financial strength, though Tesla executives said that strength is improving and relations with its suppliers are good, The Wall Street Journal reported
  this week.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating Mr. Musk's claim to have "funding secured" for a deal, and subpoenaed Tesla seeking information from each of Tesla's directors, the Journal reported last week
 .</p>
<p>Nearly a week after his initial tweet, Mr. Musk elaborated on his thinking about the go-private proposal, saying he had made it after discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund, conducted over the course of nearly two years, about providing financial support. In that Aug. 13 statement, he said he had left a meeting with the fund's managing director on July 31 confident the funding was available
 , but the statement made clear that there wasn't a final deal in place.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's explanation for scrapping the deal cited reasons that many analysts and others flagged immediately after his announcement, raising questions about why he didn't better vet the idea before taking it to Twitter.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk, who owns roughly 20% of Tesla, has said that he believed most of Tesla's current shareholders would remain investors in the company if it went private. Analysts questioned that claim, in part because of rules that limit some institutional investors' ability to hold stock in nonpublic companies.</p>
<p>In his posting Friday, Mr. Musk said that issue was a factor in changing his mind, as some of Tesla's institutional shareholders explained to him "that they have internal compliance issues that limit how much they can invest in a private company."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's initial discussion of the go-private plan also talked about creating a special-purpose fund that would let existing investors keep their shares.</p>
<p>His statement Friday said another reason for abandoning the idea was that "there is also no proven path for most retail investors to own shares if we were private."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's target price for taking Tesla private was a roughly 20% premium to where its stock was trading at the time, and Tesla's shares initially soared on the excitement of his proposal. But shares sank in the days afterward as it became clear the idea was still in the early stages and faced major hurdles. Shares ended trading Friday at $322.82, 23% below the $420 target.</p>
<p>Still, some shareholders applauded Friday's news.</p>
<p>"ARK Invest is delighted," Catherine Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, a Tesla shareholder, said in an email to the Journal after Mr. Musk's Friday announcement. Ms. Wood on Wednesday had issued an open letter pleading with Mr. Musk to stay public, arguing that taking Tesla private at $420 a share would undervalue it. She said ARK Invest believes Tesla could be worth between $700 and $4,000 a share five years from now.</p>
<p>"I believe that more investors understand how transformative Tesla will be to transportation now that they have been forced to think about the long term," Ms. Wood said Friday.</p>
<p>Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management, said on Twitter Friday that the announcement was good news, noting his clients "won't have to go through a whole process to stay owners of Tesla."</p>

His sleeping bag was still on the floor.</p>
<p>The agenda was Mr. Musk's audacious plan to take Tesla private
 , which he had sprung on the investment world 16 days earlier via tweets. He was joined in the room by board members, lawyers, bankers and advisers, members of a Wall Street transaction machine put into motion by the entrepreneur's idea.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's plan turned out more shaky than his tweets suggested. He had told the world he had funding "secured," and one tweet elaborated that the deal was so certain it needed only a shareholder vote.</p>
<p>As the team hustled to put form to his idea, lining up investors willing to put up the tens of billions of dollars required for the deal, Mr. Musk was having doubts, according to people familiar with this thinking.</p>
<p>A buyout, even if accomplished, would force some of the technology mutual funds that had been ardent supporters to trim their stakes. It might mean allowing competitors inside his tent--one of the investors his bankers had lined up was Volkswagen AG, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Taking Tesla private also would displace legions of small-fry stockholders--a merry band of electric-car fanatics willing to look past Tesla's rickety finances and its struggle to master the skill of mass-producing automobiles. Taking their place would be more sophisticated investors tugging on a tighter leash.</p>
<p>Then there was the photo emailed to him last week from an elderly couple, dressed in Tesla Inc. T-shirts and baseball caps. The couple held up a handwritten sign congratulating Mr. Musk for producing 7,000 electric cars in seven days. Their message: "Thanks, Elon! Two happy stockholders!"</p>
<p>Mr. Musk forwarded the email to a friend. "Made my day," he wrote. It also nagged at him.</p>
<p>In the conference room, bankers from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and executives at Silver Lake, the private-equity firm brought in to try to facilitate a deal, made their presentation. Then Mr. Musk rose to speak.</p>
<p>Taking Tesla private was an idea he mulled for years, and Wall Street was offering him the chance to try. Despite a meteoric stock-price rise--up 78% since the end of 2016--Mr. Musk was obsessed with short-selling investors who bet on Tesla's price declining. He complained about the scrutiny aimed at public companies, once chiding Wall Street analysts for asking "boring, bonehead" questions. Ever the optimist, he viewed Tesla as a revolutionary business with its best days ahead.</p>
<p>Then on Thursday, he told the board he wouldn't be pursuing the deal.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating his tweets about the deal, including the one saying he had "funding secured," putting Mr. Musk and the company in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's task ahead is to try to bury his private-transaction dalliance and focus instead on mass-marketing the Model 3 sedan--a bet-the-company product--at a scale and cost that could make it a mainstream automobile. The company has significant debt obligations coming due over the next year, and some of its suppliers are nervous about Tesla's ability to pay.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the value of Tesla will rise considerably in the coming months and years, possibly putting any take-private beyond the reach of any investors," Mr. Musk said Saturday in an email to The Wall Street Journal. "It was now or perhaps never."</p>
<p>This account is based on interviews with people involved in and familiar with the discussions and negotiations that stretched between Mr. Musk's first tweets and a blog post late Friday night that put a bookend on the deal.</p>
<p>Zero to 60</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's Aug. 7 tweets kicked off a frenzy of how-the-heck speculation about a going-private transaction that valued at $70 billion--Mr. Musk had offered $420 per share--a company that had never made an annual profit.</p>
<p>He hired a conventional set of deal advisers, including bankers from Goldman, and lawyers from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz.</p>
<p>Fund managers including Fidelity Investments, a longtime booster of Mr. Musk's tech empire, wouldn't be able to roll their entire stakes into a private Tesla, because of regulatory constraints, said people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Each investor that didn't stay with Tesla needed to be bought out. Weighed down with debt and bleeding cash, the company would be hard-pressed to borrow more. Mr. Musk needed new shareholders.</p>
<p>In an Aug. 13 blog post, Mr. Musk cited Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund as the source of his secured funding: "Obviously, the Saudi sovereign fund has more than enough capital needed to execute on such a transaction."</p>
<p>That rankled some senior officials in the kingdom, according to people familiar with the matter. Prince Mohammed bin Salman has big ideas to turn his petrostate into a technology and solar-power hub as part of his plans to develop its economy. And he was interested enough in Tesla to consider being part of a take-private transaction; the Saudis had already bought a near 5% stake in Tesla in the public market. But the Saudis never made a formal proposal. A Saudi government official and an adviser familiar with the talks said the country's senior leadership was divided.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's tweets and the blog post didn't help. The government official said his behavior worried some officials about his health as well as the role he would play in the company.</p>
<p>They also fretted about the expense: The Saudi sovereign-wealth fund was already weighing an investment in a Tesla competitor, and the kingdom has grandiose plans that include a massive new city in the desert.</p>
<p>For Tesla, Saudi Arabia wasn't a perfect fit either. Protective of its image as an environmentally friendly company that built cars in the U.S., some at Tesla complained to Mr. Musk about selling a large interest to a foreign oil producer.</p>
<p>That left Mr. Musk's bankers casting around for others: car companies, sovereign-wealth funds, anyone who might take a strategic interest in Tesla--or who would be willing to make a big bet.</p>
<p>Machine in motion</p>
<p>Despite his over-the-top public persona, Mr. Musk keeps close counsel. A key group of Tesla executives have been at his side for years, including Chief Technology Officer J.B. Straubel; General Counsel Todd Maron, who once was his divorce lawyer, and finance chief Deepak Ahuja, who returned to the company last year after retiring from the same role in 2015.</p>
<p>Tesla's board recently added independent directors James Murdoch and Linda Johnson Rice but is still dominated by Mr. Musk's longtime supporters, including his brother, Kimbal Musk, a close confidant.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk had spoken in recent years to Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Inc., who had taken his own company public, then private a quarter-century later and then public again, according to a person familiar with the discussion.</p>
<p>Once Mr. Musk raised the idea of a transaction, he expanded his advisers beyond his West Coast loyalists. He brought in Egon Durban of Silver Lake, who had brokered and helped bankroll the Dell buyout. Gregg Lemkau and Dan Dees of Goldman came on board, too, to advise Mr. Musk and tap the firm's connections to wealthy investors around the world.</p>
<p>By Saturday, Aug. 18, the deal machinery was fully in motion. The Tesla board held a meeting by telephone, with Mr. Musk and his brother Kimbal huddled in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk presented ideas about how a transaction could be structured. When asked about his earlier promise that individual investors would be able to join, he acknowledged it might not work, according to people briefed on the discussions. The meeting ended on a positive note, though, one of the people said, with most directors believing Mr. Musk remained committed to the idea.</p>
<p>Following the meeting, however, Mr. Musk sought private counsel about whether to proceed from several board members. He got conflicting advice.</p>
<p>Board members remained supportive of Mr. Musk, several people familiar with its discussions said, but some were whipsawed by the tweets. He told the board he understood that his tweets had been rash and promised to exercise more self-control, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk seemed to view such a complex corporate transaction as an engineering problem he could solve--much as he had spent time pursuing the idea of a submarine to rescue a soccer team trapped in the waters of a Thai cave.</p>
<p>After the board meeting, Mr. Musk went to the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif. He stayed into the early morning, tweeting at 2:32 a.m. that he had just gotten home. He slept most of the next day.</p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday, advisers from Goldman and Silver Lake plowed ahead on a deal that might work.</p>
<p>By Wednesday evening, they had a presentation for Mr. Musk, proposing a roster of deep-pocketed investors, including Volkswagen and Silver Lake itself, that had agreed to contribute as much as $30 billion, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>They weren't the kind of investors Mr. Musk had in mind. He was deeply suspicious of rival car companies, believing they wanted to piggyback on what he called the "Tesla halo." He also was lamenting a loss of small investors, who had been his most vocal champions.</p>
<p>Finally, the deal team advised him, the money would likely come with strings attached: The new investors would want a lot of say in the company, and each would likely want to hammer out terms of their own.</p>
<p>The following day, Thursday, the board meeting was convened at the Tesla factory conference room. Mr. Musk had told some board members earlier in the day that he had doubts about the proposal, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The advisers said they were confident it could be done, and then left.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Musk spoke. Based on the latest information I have, he said, I'm withdrawing the proposal.</p>
<p>"Woohoo," one board member let out.</p>

His sleeping bag was still on the floor.</p>
<p>The agenda was Mr. Musk's audacious plan to take Tesla private
 , which he had sprung on the investment world 16 days earlier via tweets. He was joined in the room by board members, lawyers, bankers and advisers, members of a Wall Street transaction machine put into motion by the entrepreneur's idea.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's plan turned out more shaky than his tweets suggested. He had told the world he had funding "secured," and one tweet elaborated that the deal was so certain it needed only a shareholder vote.</p>
<p>As the team hustled to put form to his idea, lining up investors willing to put up the tens of billions of dollars required for the deal, Mr. Musk was having doubts, according to people familiar with this thinking.</p>
<p>A buyout, even if accomplished, would force some of the technology mutual funds that had been ardent supporters to trim their stakes. It might mean allowing competitors inside his tent--one of the investors his bankers had lined up was Volkswagen AG, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Taking Tesla private also would displace legions of small-fry stockholders--a merry band of electric-car fanatics willing to look past Tesla's rickety finances and its struggle to master the skill of mass-producing automobiles. Taking their place would be more sophisticated investors tugging on a tighter leash.</p>
<p>Then there was the photo emailed to him last week from an elderly couple, dressed in Tesla Inc. T-shirts and baseball caps. The couple held up a handwritten sign congratulating Mr. Musk for producing 7,000 electric cars in seven days. Their message: "Thanks, Elon! Two happy stockholders!"</p>
<p>Mr. Musk forwarded the email to a friend. "Made my day," he wrote. It also nagged at him.</p>
<p>In the conference room, bankers from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and executives at Silver Lake, the private-equity firm brought in to try to facilitate a deal, made their presentation. Then Mr. Musk rose to speak.</p>
<p>Taking Tesla private was an idea he mulled for years, and Wall Street was offering him the chance to try. Despite a meteoric stock-price rise--up 78% since the end of 2016--Mr. Musk was obsessed with short-selling investors who bet on Tesla's price declining. He complained about the scrutiny aimed at public companies, once chiding Wall Street analysts for asking "boring, bonehead" questions. Ever the optimist, he viewed Tesla as a revolutionary business with its best days ahead.</p>
<p>Then on Thursday, he told the board he wouldn't be pursuing the deal.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating his tweets about the deal, including the one saying he had "funding secured," putting Mr. Musk and the company in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's task ahead is to try to bury his private-transaction dalliance and focus instead on mass-marketing the Model 3 sedan--a bet-the-company product--at a scale and cost that could make it a mainstream automobile. The company has significant debt obligations coming due over the next year, and some of its suppliers are nervous about Tesla's ability to pay.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the value of Tesla will rise considerably in the coming months and years, possibly putting any take-private beyond the reach of any investors," Mr. Musk said Saturday in an email to The Wall Street Journal. "It was now or perhaps never."</p>
<p>This account is based on interviews with people involved in and familiar with the discussions and negotiations that stretched between Mr. Musk's first tweets and a blog post late Friday night that put a bookend on the deal.</p>
<p>Zero to 60</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's Aug. 7 tweets kicked off a frenzy of how-the-heck speculation about a going-private transaction that valued at $70 billion--Mr. Musk had offered $420 per share--a company that had never made an annual profit.</p>
<p>He hired a conventional set of deal advisers, including bankers from Goldman, and lawyers from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz.</p>
<p>Fund managers including Fidelity Investments, a longtime booster of Mr. Musk's tech empire, wouldn't be able to roll their entire stakes into a private Tesla, because of regulatory constraints, said people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Each investor that didn't stay with Tesla needed to be bought out. Weighed down with debt and bleeding cash, the company would be hard-pressed to borrow more. Mr. Musk needed new shareholders.</p>
<p>In an Aug. 13 blog post, Mr. Musk cited Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund as the source of his secured funding: "Obviously, the Saudi sovereign fund has more than enough capital needed to execute on such a transaction."</p>
<p>That rankled some senior officials in the kingdom, according to people familiar with the matter. Prince Mohammed bin Salman has big ideas to turn his petrostate into a technology and solar-power hub as part of his plans to develop its economy. And he was interested enough in Tesla to consider being part of a take-private transaction; the Saudis had already bought a near 5% stake in Tesla in the public market. But the Saudis never made a formal proposal. A Saudi government official and an adviser familiar with the talks said the country's senior leadership was divided.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's tweets and the blog post didn't help. The government official said his behavior worried some officials about his health as well as the role he would play in the company.</p>
<p>They also fretted about the expense: The Saudi sovereign-wealth fund was already weighing an investment in a Tesla competitor, and the kingdom has grandiose plans that include a massive new city in the desert.</p>
<p>For Tesla, Saudi Arabia wasn't a perfect fit either. Protective of its image as an environmentally friendly company that built cars in the U.S., some at Tesla complained to Mr. Musk about selling a large interest to a foreign oil producer.</p>
<p>That left Mr. Musk's bankers casting around for others: car companies, sovereign-wealth funds, anyone who might take a strategic interest in Tesla--or who would be willing to make a big bet.</p>
<p>Machine in motion</p>
<p>Despite his over-the-top public persona, Mr. Musk keeps close counsel. A key group of Tesla executives have been at his side for years, including Chief Technology Officer J.B. Straubel; General Counsel Todd Maron, who once was his divorce lawyer, and finance chief Deepak Ahuja, who returned to the company last year after retiring from the same role in 2015.</p>
<p>Tesla's board recently added independent directors James Murdoch and Linda Johnson Rice but is still dominated by Mr. Musk's longtime supporters, including his brother, Kimbal Musk, a close confidant.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk had spoken in recent years to Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Inc., who had taken his own company public, then private a quarter-century later and then public again, according to a person familiar with the discussion.</p>
<p>Once Mr. Musk raised the idea of a transaction, he expanded his advisers beyond his West Coast loyalists. He brought in Egon Durban of Silver Lake, who had brokered and helped bankroll the Dell buyout. Gregg Lemkau and Dan Dees of Goldman came on board, too, to advise Mr. Musk and tap the firm's connections to wealthy investors around the world.</p>
<p>By Saturday, Aug. 18, the deal machinery was fully in motion. The Tesla board held a meeting by telephone, with Mr. Musk and his brother Kimbal huddled in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk presented ideas about how a transaction could be structured. When asked about his earlier promise that individual investors would be able to join, he acknowledged it might not work, according to people briefed on the discussions. The meeting ended on a positive note, though, one of the people said, with most directors believing Mr. Musk remained committed to the idea.</p>
<p>Following the meeting, however, Mr. Musk sought private counsel about whether to proceed from several board members. He got conflicting advice.</p>
<p>Board members remained supportive of Mr. Musk, several people familiar with its discussions said, but some were whipsawed by the tweets. He told the board he understood that his tweets had been rash and promised to exercise more self-control, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk seemed to view such a complex corporate transaction as an engineering problem he could solve--much as he had spent time pursuing the idea of a submarine to rescue a soccer team trapped in the waters of a Thai cave.</p>
<p>After the board meeting, Mr. Musk went to the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif. He stayed into the early morning, tweeting at 2:32 a.m. that he had just gotten home. He slept most of the next day.</p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday, advisers from Goldman and Silver Lake plowed ahead on a deal that might work.</p>

Despite a meteoric stock-price rise -- up 78% since the end of 2016 -- Mr. Musk was obsessed with short-selling investors who bet on Tesla's price declining. He complained about the scrutiny aimed at public companies, once chiding Wall Street analysts for asking "boring, bonehead" questions. Ever the optimist, he viewed Tesla as a revolutionary business with its best days ahead.</p>
<p>Then on Thursday, he told the board he wouldn't be pursuing the deal.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating his tweets about the deal, including the one saying he had "funding secured," putting Mr. Musk and the company in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's task ahead is to try to bury his private-transaction dalliance and focus instead on mass-marketing the Model 3 sedan -- a bet-the-company product -- at a scale and cost that could make it a mainstream automobile. The company has significant debt obligations coming due over the next year, and some of its suppliers are nervous about Tesla's ability to pay.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the value of Tesla will rise considerably in the coming months and years, possibly putting any take-private beyond the reach of any investors," Mr. Musk said Saturday in an email to The Wall Street Journal. "It was now or perhaps never."</p>
<p>This account is based on interviews with people involved in and familiar with the discussions and negotiations that stretched between Mr. Musk's first tweets and a blog post late Friday night that put a bookend on the deal.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's Aug. 7 tweets kicked off a frenzy of how-the-heck speculation about a going-private transaction that valued at $70 billion -- Mr. Musk had offered $420 per share -- a company that had never made an annual profit.</p>
<p>He hired a conventional set of deal advisers, including bankers from Goldman, and lawyers from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz.</p>
<p>Fund managers including Fidelity Investments, a longtime booster of Mr. Musk's tech empire, wouldn't be able to roll their entire stakes into a private Tesla, because of regulatory constraints, said people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Each investor that didn't stay with Tesla needed to be bought out. Weighed down with debt and bleeding cash, the company would be hard-pressed to borrow. Mr. Musk needed new shareholders.</p>
<p>In an Aug. 13 blog post, Mr. Musk cited Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund as the source of his secured funding: "Obviously, the Saudi sovereign fund has more than enough capital needed to execute on such a transaction."</p>
<p>That rankled some senior officials in the kingdom, according to people familiar with the matter. Prince Mohammed bin Salman has big ideas to turn his petrostate into a technology and solar-power hub as part of his plans to develop its economy. And he was interested enough in Tesla to consider being part of a take-private transaction; the Saudis had already bought a near 5% stake in Tesla in the public market. But the Saudis never made a formal proposal. A Saudi government official and an adviser familiar with the talks said the country's senior leadership was divided.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's tweets and the blog post didn't help. The government official said his behavior worried some officials about his health as well as the role he would play in the company.</p>
<p>They also fretted about the expense: The Saudi sovereign-wealth fund was already weighing an investment in a Tesla competitor, and the kingdom has grandiose plans that include a massive new city in the desert.</p>
<p>For Tesla, Saudi Arabia wasn't a perfect fit either. Protective of its image as an environmentally friendly company that built cars in the U.S., some at Tesla complained to Mr. Musk about selling a large interest to a foreign oil producer.</p>
<p>That left Mr. Musk's bankers casting around for others: car companies, sovereign-wealth funds, anyone who might take a strategic interest in Tesla -- or who would be willing to make a big bet.</p>
<p>Despite his over-the-top public persona, Mr. Musk keeps close counsel. A key group of Tesla executives have been at his side for years, including Chief Technology Officer J.B. Straubel; General Counsel Todd Maron, who once was his divorce lawyer, and finance chief Deepak Ahuja, who returned to the company last year after retiring from the same role in 2015.</p>
<p>Tesla's board recently added independent directors James Murdoch and Linda Johnson Rice but is still dominated by Mr. Musk's longtime supporters, including his brother, Kimbal Musk, a confidant.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk had spoken in recent years to Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Inc., who had taken his own company public, then private a quarter-century later and then public again, according to a person familiar with the discussion.</p>
<p>Once Mr. Musk raised the idea of a transaction, he expanded his advisers beyond his West Coast loyalists. He brought in Egon Durban of Silver Lake, who had brokered and helped bankroll the Dell buyout. Gregg Lemkau and Dan Dees of Goldman came on board, too, to advise Mr. Musk and tap the firm's connections to wealthy investors around the world.</p>
<p>By Saturday, Aug. 18, the deal machinery was fully in motion. The Tesla board held a meeting by telephone, with Mr. Musk and his brother Kimbal huddled in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk presented ideas about how a transaction could be structured. When asked about his earlier promise that individual investors would be able to join, he acknowledged it might not work, according to people briefed on the discussions. The meeting ended on a positive note, though, one of the people said, with most directors believing Mr. Musk remained committed to the idea.</p>
<p>Following the meeting, however, Mr. Musk sought private counsel about whether to proceed from several board members. He got conflicting advice.</p>
<p>Board members remained supportive of Mr. Musk, several people familiar with its discussions said, but some were whipsawed by the tweets. He told the board he understood that his tweets had been rash and promised to exercise more self-control, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk seemed to view such a complex corporate transaction as an engineering problem he could solve -- much as he had spent time pursuing the idea of a submarine to rescue a soccer team trapped in the waters of a Thai cave.</p>
<p>After the board meeting, Mr. Musk went to the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif. He stayed into the early morning, tweeting at 2:32 a.m. that he had just gotten home. He slept most of the next day.</p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday, advisers from Goldman and Silver Lake plowed ahead on a deal that might work.</p>
<p>By Wednesday evening, they had a presentation for Mr. Musk, proposing a roster of deep-pocketed investors, including Volkswagen and Silver Lake itself, that had agreed to contribute as much as $30 billion, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>They weren't the kind of investors Mr. Musk had in mind. He was suspicious of rival car companies, believing they wanted to piggyback on what he called the "Tesla halo." He also was lamenting a loss of small investors, who had been his most vocal champions.</p>
<p>Finally, the deal team advised him, the money would likely come with strings attached: The new investors would want a lot of say in the company, and each would likely want to hammer out terms of their own.</p>
<p>The following day, Thursday, the board meeting was convened at the Tesla factory conference room. Mr. Musk had told some board members earlier in the day that he had doubts about the proposal, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The advisers said they were confident it could be done, and then left.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Musk spoke. Based on the latest information I have, he said, I'm withdrawing the proposal.</p>
<p>"Woohoo," one board member let out.</p>

<p>Now that Mr. Musk has squashed efforts to take Tesla Inc. private, the spotlight will turn back to the auto maker's operational challenges, namely whether it can maintain its grueling production pace for the Model 3 to meet customer demand and generate cash to stave off fundraising.</p>
<p>Tesla's shares fell 1.1% to $319.27 on Monday as investors digested the 17-day drama that began Aug. 7 with a shocking tweet from Mr. Musk saying he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share. As details emerged, however, it became clear that a deal was far from finalized as he and Tesla directors raced to put in place financial and legal teams required to put one in place.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk pulled the plug on the suggestion last Thursday in a meeting with his board at the auto maker's Fremont, Calif., factory, and then announced the decision late Friday after the market closed. Staying public means Mr. Musk will need to continue answering to shareholders about periodic goals, while fending off investors who are shorting the company's stock.</p>
<p>Analysts on Monday were quick to question Mr. Musk's credibility and Tesla's financial prospects now that the auto maker isn't tapping investors for more money.</p>
<p>"His credibility has taken a hit--there's not question about it," Gene Munster, managing partner at investment and research firm Loup Ventures, said. "The more important question is: will it recover?"</p>
<p>Ryan Brinkman at J.P. Morgan had already cut his estimate for Tesla's share price to $195 a share ahead of Mr. Musk's announcement on the revelations that a deal wasn't as close to completion as it initially appeared.</p>
<p>Following Friday's announcement, Philippe Houchois, an analyst for Jefferies, warned clients to expect a hit to shares on Monday, noting "more erratic corporate behavior" by Tesla.</p>
<p>"We wonder if the 'going private' tweet has effectively put Tesla in play and may lead to additional discussions with other investors, mainly corporates, that value Tesla's vision and can help bridge gaps in growth and execution skills," he wrote in a note.</p>
<p>Among those who are scrutinizing Mr. Musk's Aug. 7 tweets are the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is examining Mr. Musk's claim to have "funding secured" for a deal
 .</p>
<p>Some analysts and investors were sanguine about Tesla's decision to stay public. ARK Invest, a Tesla shareholder, said it was "delighted" because it believes Tesla's stock could be worth far more as a public company.</p>
<p>"We are not surprised that the bid failed, as there were many hurdles to leap," Efraim Levy, an analyst for CFRA Research, said in a note Monday. "We believe that there are more benefits for [Tesla] by staying public than by going private and adding additional debt to a leveraged balance sheet."</p>
<p>In his late night posting Friday, Mr. Musk noted the distraction that proposal had become, something unwelcome as he tries to focus the company on building the Model 3.</p>
<p>"I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it's clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated," Mr. Musk wrote Friday. "This is a problem because we absolutely must stay focused on ramping Model 3 and becoming profitable."</p>
<p>For months, Tesla struggled to reach its much-delayed goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a single week, finally meeting the milestone at the end of June. But Tesla had to build a general assembly line under a tent outside the factory to do it, and the grind included Tesla employees to work overtime and on the weekends, with Mr. Musk sleeping in the factory.</p>
<p>The struggle also ate away at Tesla's limited cash, fanning concerns about the company's finances. Some suppliers have worried about Tesla's financial strength and about getting paid
 , The Wall Street Journal recently reported.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has repeated that Tesla is on track to generate cash this quarter and turn a profit. Tesla's cash and cash equivalents fell to $1.69 billion as of Aug. 12 from $2.24 billion on June 30, according to internal records reviewed by the Journal.</p>
<p>The drop was largely because it repaid $500 million of a revolving credit line in July. Tesla plans to tap that same amount again later this quarter, according to the records. That, plus additional cash flow that Tesla anticipates from an increase in vehicle deliveries in the second half of the quarter, is expected to leave it with several hundred million dollars more in cash at the end of September compared with three months earlier, according to the records.</p>
<p>On Friday, board members, in a statement, expressed support for the Mr. Musk, who has admitted that the pace to ramp up Model 3 production took a personal toll. He indicated last year it would be a difficult process
 , warning of a coming "manufacturing hell" but has said he didn't expect it to be this hard.</p>
<p>Part of the problems have revolved around Mr. Musk's desire to rely on automation at the assembly factory, an effort he admitted was a mistake because it overly complicated the effort.</p>
<p>Tesla's next test: Mr. Musk set a goal to increase its Model 3 output to 6,000 vehicles a week by late August. The auto maker has one week to go.</p>

<p>Now that Mr. Musk has squashed efforts to take Tesla Inc. private, the spotlight will turn back to the auto maker's operational challenges, namely whether it can maintain its grueling production pace for the Model 3 to meet customer demand and generate cash to stave off fundraising.</p>
<p>Tesla's shares fell 1.1% to $319.27 on Monday as investors digested the 17-day drama that began Aug. 7 with a shocking tweet from Mr. Musk saying he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share. As details emerged, however, it became clear that a deal was far from finalized as he and Tesla directors raced to put in place financial and legal teams needed to seal a deal.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk pulled the plug on the suggestion last Thursday in a meeting with his board at the auto maker's Fremont, Calif., factory, and then announced the decision late Friday after the market closed. Staying public means Mr. Musk will need to continue answering to shareholders about periodic goals, while fending off investors who are shorting the company's stock.</p>
<p>Analysts on Monday were quick to question Mr. Musk's credibility and Tesla's financial prospects now that the auto maker isn't tapping investors for more money.</p>
<p>"His credibility has taken a hit--there's no question about it," Gene Munster, managing partner at investment and research firm Loup Ventures, said. "The more important question is: Will it recover?"</p>
<p>Ryan Brinkman at J.P. Morgan had already cut his estimate for Tesla's share price to $195 a share ahead of Mr. Musk's announcement on the revelations that a deal wasn't as close to completion as it initially appeared.</p>
<p>Following Friday's announcement, Philippe Houchois, an analyst for Jefferies, warned clients to expect a hit to shares on Monday, noting "more erratic corporate behavior" by Tesla.</p>
<p>"We wonder if the 'going private' tweet has effectively put Tesla in play and may lead to additional discussions with other investors, mainly corporates, that value Tesla's vision and can help bridge gaps in growth and execution skills," he wrote in a note.</p>
<p>Among those who are scrutinizing Mr. Musk's Aug. 7 tweets are the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is examining Mr. Musk's claim to have "funding secured" for a deal
 .</p>
<p>Some analysts and investors were sanguine about Tesla's decision to stay public. ARK Invest, a Tesla shareholder, said it was "delighted" because it believes Tesla's stock could be worth far more as a public company.</p>
<p>"We are not surprised that the bid failed, as there were many hurdles to leap," Efraim Levy, an analyst for CFRA Research, said in a note Monday. "We believe that there are more benefits for [Tesla] by staying public than by going private and adding additional debt to a leveraged balance sheet."</p>
<p>In his late night posting Friday, Mr. Musk noted the distraction that proposal had become, something unwelcome as he tries to focus the company on building the Model 3.</p>
<p>"I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it's clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated," Mr. Musk wrote Friday. "This is a problem because we absolutely must stay focused on ramping Model 3 and becoming profitable."</p>
<p>For months, Tesla struggled to reach its much-delayed goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a single week, finally meeting the milestone at the end of June. But Tesla had to build a general assembly line under a tent outside the factory to do it, and the grind included Tesla employees to work overtime and on the weekends, with Mr. Musk sleeping in the factory.</p>
<p>The struggle also ate away at Tesla's limited cash, fanning concerns about the company's finances. Some suppliers have worried about Tesla's financial strength and about getting paid
 , The Wall Street Journal recently reported.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has repeated that Tesla is on track to generate cash this quarter and turn a profit. Tesla's cash and cash equivalents fell to $1.69 billion as of Aug. 12 from $2.24 billion on June 30, according to internal records reviewed by the Journal.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-headquartered company, which has billed itself as an emerging rival to Tesla, is planning to list
  on the New York Stock Exchange in about two weeks.</p>
<p>NIO launched an initial public offering of 160 million American depositary receipts at a price range of $6.25 to $8.25. That values the car maker at up to $8.5 billion ahead of its trading debut.</p>
<p>At the top of the price range, NIO would raise gross proceeds of $1.32 billion. The company could raise as much as $1.52 billion in total if an option to sell 15% more stock is exercised after the shares begin trading.</p>
<p>Still, the offering size is smaller than what NIO was aiming for earlier this year, when the company was hoping to raise at least $2 billion in its IPO, according to an earlier report by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>NIO was incorporated in 2014 by Chinese entrepreneur Bin Li, who serves as the company's chief executive and will control 48.3% of the company's voting rights after the IPO.</p>
<p>The company late last year launched its first production car model
 --a seven-seater electric sport-utility vehicle--and by July had delivered close to 500 vehicles to customers. It said in its listing prospectus that it had 15,761 unfulfilled reservations for the vehicle. NIO also plans to launch a second, smaller SUV this year, with deliveries expected to start during the first half of 2019.</p>
<p>NIO has yet to turn a profit. The company generated revenue of $7 million in the first half of 2018 and reported a net loss of $503 million, according to its prospectus.</p>
<p>The company was last valued at $5 billion in a private capital raise in November 2017. NIO's other shareholders include entities affiliated with Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and China-focused investment firm Hillhouse Capital Group.</p>
<p>Hillhouse, which controls entities with a 7.5% stake in NIO, is planning to buy at least $150 million worth of the IPO shares, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>NIO is riding on strong growth in China's booming electric-vehicle market. It has been spending heavily on lavish events and marketing efforts to attract attention in a country that is home to roughly 500 electric-car makers. It rented a large stadium for the launch of its first car in Beijing late last year, flying in thousands of employees from around the world as well as U.S. rock band Imagine Dragons to provide the entertainment.</p>
<p>By September, NIO will operate about 20 showrooms in prime locations such as Shanghai Tower. But NIO doesn't primarily sell cars in these spaces, which it describes as "clubs" for people to hang out and drink coffee. NIO is also building a network of battery-swap stations that allow NIO drivers to switch out their car batteries for freshly charged ones.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether NIO's debut car, the ES8 SUV, is sufficiently exciting to justify these large expenditures. Starting at about $68,000, the ES8 may be half the price of a Tesla Model X in China, but auto analysts stress that a new brand needs to bring something truly exceptional to market to generate sales momentum--and some doubt whether that secret sauce is evident in NIO's first product.</p>

  in Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO Inc., has decided not to invest in the Shanghai-based startup's initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>SoftBank had considered buying about $200 million worth of shares in NIO's IPO, The Wall Street Journal reported in April. It couldn't be learned why the Japanese tech giant walked away from the potential investment. One of the people said SoftBank is actively looking at the electric-vehicle sector but hasn't decided which company to back.</p>
<p>NIO, which has billed itself as an emerging competitor to Tesla Inc., is going public
  on the New York Stock Exchange. The company earlier this week launched a stock sale that could raise up to $1.32 billion. It plans to sell 160 million American depositary receipts at a price range of $6.25 to $8.25, which would value the car maker at up to $8.5 billion ahead of its trading debut.</p>
<p>If an option to sell 15% more stock is exercised, NIO's IPO could raise as much as $1.52 billion. The offering is scheduled to price on Sep. 11 and the shares should begin trading the next day.</p>
<p>NIO was incorporated in 2014 by Bin Li, a Chinese entrepreneur, and this year started selling its first electric cars. The company isn't profitable yet. Its shareholders include entities affiliated with Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and China-focused investment firm Hillhouse Capital Group.</p>
<p>The company is one of several electric-vehicle makers raising funds as the sector's growth surges
 . Xiaopeng Motors, a Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturer backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., said earlier this month it had raised 4 billion yuan ($586.4 million) from private investors, valuing the company at nearly 25 billion yuan. The company is planning to raise more private capital in the next six months, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Another Chinese company, Singulato Motors
 , said it raised 3 billion yuan earlier this year.</p>
<p>SoftBank is Alibaba's largest shareholder, with a roughly 30% stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant. The two companies' founders sit on each other's boards.</p>
<p>SoftBank has been collecting stakes in companies with driverless car technologies. Through its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund
 , SoftBank has invested in General Motors Co.'s driverless car unit GM Cruise Holdings
  and autonomous vehicle startups Nauto Inc., Mapbox Inc. and Improbable.</p>
<p>SoftBank also owns stakes in Uber Technologies Inc., China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and other ride-hailing companies, which amass data on when people travel and why--something SoftBank's billionaire founder Masayoshi Son said will become more valuable with the arrival of self-driving cars.</p>

The nearly 2,500 picks include tech stocks, food companies, marijuana producers and the fear gauge.</p>
<p>Readers have four more days to pick stocks and compete 
 with the Heard's writers. Results of the contest will be published in December.</p>
<p>Some 13 of the top 14 names through Wednesday were widely held technology stocks, with Amazon.com and Apple, the world's first two trillion-dollar companies
 , in the top five. Also reflecting a recent theme, three of readers' most popular picks were marijuana companies.</p>
<p>What we didn't expect was quite so much contrarian thinking. The most crowded pick by far was electric-car maker Tesla. But, of the 123 readers who named Tesla, four out of five bet its shares would fall. Readers have been paying attention to the Heard's skeptical take 
 on the controversial company and its polarizing boss
 , Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Other pans include Snap Inc. More than half of the readers who chose it expect it to drop by the time the contest ends on Dec. 14. Readers also were pessimistic about Chipotle Mexican Grill and Campbell Soup.</p>
<p>But, when it comes to the U.S. market overall, it was something of a split decision. A surprising two-thirds of those picking an exchange-traded fund that mirrors the S&amp;P 500 thought it would be lower while a similar proportion thought a fairly calm market would get even more placid, reflected by a drop in the VIX, the market's "fear gauge."</p>
<p>A bet on volatility may be a huge risk for a person's stock portfolio, but it makes sense for a contest where readers are competing against a large field--thousands of people just like them. With only their pride at stake, the key to victory in such a contest is to go big or go home.</p>
<p>Along those lines, one popular pick was Helios &amp; Matheson Analytics, the backer of the flailing MoviePass service
 . The company's shares are down 99.9% over the past year, yet nearly 70% of the readers who named the stock believe it has more upside than downside. Perhaps a Hollywood ending will occur. Though less extreme in terms of potential payoff, beleaguered General Electric and Deutsche Bank, both recently ejected from benchmark stock indexes, mostly attracted long picks. Sagging Turkish assets, both stocks and the ailing lira, were another story, with universal pessimism.</p>
<p>Say what you want about the ability of journalists to pick stocks, but at least one of the Heard's picks will be tough to beat: Dan Gallagher's choice of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices is up nearly 40% in just over three weeks.</p>

<p>Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management owns about 38,000 shares of Tesla Inc. worth roughly $10 million at Friday's closing price of $263.24. An earlier version of this article misstated the total value as roughly $1 million. (Sept. 9)</p>
<p>Tesla Inc.'s share price sank to near its lowest point for the year Friday after the electric-car maker lost more executives and Chief Executive Elon Musk appeared to smoke marijuana during an interview streamed on the web.</p>
<p>Dave Morton, touted by Tesla in late July as part of "key new talent" hired after a spell of executive departures, said Friday in a filing that he left because the public attention on the company and its pace were too much. Tesla also confirmed that Gabrielle Toledano, its head of human resources, wouldn't rejoin Tesla after her leave of absence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Musk's actions in a late-night interview with comedian Joe Rogan--drinking whiskey and revealing a personal side of himself--was another example of the CEO's unorthodox style that has won him legions of fans. But some analysts and investors say his erratic behavior 
 is creating distractions for the company and its employees.</p>
<p>"We believe evidence is becoming more clear that Tesla needs to entertain a major change in the C-Suite," Jamie Albertine, an analyst for Consumer Edge, wrote in a report Friday. "The ongoing, effectively self-inflicted public relations crisis is now affecting key personnel within the organization."</p>
<p>Tesla's shares on Friday fell 6.3% to $263.24, approaching its 52-week low of $244.59. They are down 31% since Aug. 7 when Mr. Musk declared in a tweet that he had funding secured to take the company private at $420 a share.</p>
<p>Tesla's bonds, meanwhile, had their second-biggest one-day decline on record. "The judgment of the chief executive is coming under scrutiny," said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union.</p>
<p>Later on Friday, Mr. Musk announced in a memo to employees several high-level promotions, including installing veteran Tesla manager Jerome Guillen as president of automotive. The newly created position could help bolster leadership in manufacturing and relieve some of the day-to-day pressure on Mr. Musk, who had taken direct control of these areas earlier this year.</p>
<p>"For awhile, there will be a lot of fuss and noise in the media," Mr. Musk wrote in the memo posted on Tesla's website. "Just ignore them. Results are what matter."</p>
<p>The latest events further test a company that is dealing with the fallout from Mr. Musk's abandoned attempt to take it private, pressure to meet key production goals, concerns over its cash position and questions about the CEO's behavior.</p>
<p>Some of Tesla's supportive investors were chagrined by Mr. Musk's latest antics. He "gave the short sellers another life," Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management, said on Twitter early Friday. "Creating a totally unnecessary crisis of confidence. Even as they report incredible growth in operating numbers." His firm owns about 38,000 Tesla shares worth roughly $10 million.</p>
<p>In an email before Mr. Musk's Friday afternoon memo, Mr. Gerber said Mr. Musk at least appeared happy in the interview, countering a narrative that he is personally struggling. "I'm just not happy the [board of directors] is not announcing executives being added to support Tesla," he said. "They need someone solid for perception ASAP."</p>
<p>Later in the day, Mr. Gerber said Friday's news of promotions appeared to address his concerns.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton, the departing accounting chief, said he had "no disagreements with Tesla's leadership or its financial reporting," and that he still believed in "Tesla, its mission and its future prospects."</p>
<p>He and Ms. Toledano joined other notable executives who have left Tesla this year, including engineering chief Doug Field, who ended up at Apple Inc., and sales and marketing president John McNeill, who went to the ride-hailing service Lyft Inc. Ms. Toledano's decision was earlier reported by Bloomberg.</p>
<p>More than 50 vice presidents or higher have left the company in the past two years. Mr. Musk has said he sees executive turnover as being in line with that of other large companies and has announced plans for a reorganization aimed at flattening the layers of managers.</p>
<p>Amid Tesla's difficulties, Mr. Musk took a break on Thursday night to appear on the popular podcast, "The Joe Rogan Experience," streamed live on YouTube and hosted by Mr. Rogan. The interview, which lasted more than 2 &frac12; hours and stretched past midnight, was provocative, at times turning personal. The entrepreneur, wearing a black T-shirt with the words "Occupy Mars," expressed his concerns about the dangers of artificial intelligence, explored his vision for an electric supersonic airplane and said his brain is a "never-ending explosion of ideas."</p>
<p>Near the end, Mr. Rogan lighted what he said was "marijuana inside of tobacco" and asked Mr. Musk if he had ever smoked marijuana before.</p>
<p>"I think I tried one once," Mr. Musk said, laughing. "You probably can't because of stockholders, right?" Mr. Rogan asked. "I mean, it's legal right?" Mr. Musk said. "Totally legal," Mr. Rogan replied. The interview was filmed in the Los Angeles metro area, where marijuana is allowed under state law.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk then put the marijuana cigarette to his mouth and took one puff before handing it back. He said he "almost never" smokes it and that he didn't feel an effect.</p>
<p>"I know a lot of people like weed--and that's fine--but I don't find that it is very useful for productivity," Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has drawn attention recently for his occasional public outbursts. In the past few months, he has lashed out at analysts on a quarterly conference call for asking "boring, bonehead" questions, suggested on Twitter that a British cave explorer was a pedophile, and on Aug. 7 declared he had secured funding to take Tesla private when it later was revealed he was still trying to line up investors to propose a deal.</p>
<p>Following the spell of erratic behavior, some investors and analysts have questioned Mr. Musk's fitness as CEO. Friends and family say they are concerned Mr. Musk is fatigued and overworked. Mr. Musk has talked about struggling with sleep and his use of the sleeping drug Ambien. When the drug doesn't work, weariness saps his productivity the next day, according to a person familiar with his usage.</p>
<p>Last month, singer Azealia Banks suggested on Instagram that Mr. Musk used LSD while tweeting. A spokesperson for Mr. Musk called that claim "complete nonsense." Ms. Banks, who later apologized, made the accusation in the days after Mr. Musk's going-private tweet.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk scrapped the idea 16 days later and now faces an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission into whether he misled investors. The Tesla board wasn't happy with Mr. Musk's use of Twitter and has told him to be more careful, a person familiar with the matter previously told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Regarding his thoughts on Twitter, Mr. Musk said in the interview he tries to ignore most negative comments "but every now and again, you get drawn in. It's not good. You can make mistakes."</p>

<p>Mr. Morton is the latest Tesla executive to leave the company, which has seen key engineering, technical and sales executives depart. Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he sees executive turnover as being in line with that of other large companies and has announced plans for a reorganization aimed at flattening the layers of managers.</p>
<p>Tesla's stock price fell around 7% in morning trading to about $262. The sharp drop also came after Mr. Musk appeared to smoke marijuana 
 on Thursday during a live interview, in which he spoke for more than 2&frac12; hours on topics ranging from the dangers of artificial intelligence to his use of Twitter.</p>
<p>In a securities filing Friday, Tesla said Mr. Morton resigned, effective immediately, on Tuesday after joining the company Aug. 6.</p>
<p>"The level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations. As a result, this caused me to reconsider my future," Mr. Morton said in the filing.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton said he had "no disagreements with Tesla's leadership or its financial reporting," and that he still believed in "Tesla, its mission and its future prospects." Tesla said its accounting and personnel functions will be overseen by Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja and its corporate controller, "as had been the case prior to and during Dave's transition to Tesla."</p>
<p>Mr. Morton joined the electric auto maker from Seagate Technology Plc., where he served as its chief financial officer. He had replaced Eric Branderiz, who left Tesla in March.</p>
<p>The notable executives who have left Tesla this year include senior executive
  Matthew Schwall, who went to Waymo; engineering chief Doug Field, who ended up at Apple Inc.; and sales and marketing president John McNeill, who went to the ride-hailing service Lyft Inc.</p>
<p>In addition, Bloomberg News reported Friday that Gabrielle Toledano, the head of human resources, said she wouldn't rejoin the company after her leave of absence.</p>
<p>Overall, at least 50 vice presidents or higher-ranking executives have departed
  over the past 24 months, according to people familiar with the company, partly because of its acquisition of SolarCity Corp.</p>

<p>The company announced
  Friday morning that Chief Accounting Officer Dave Morton had stepped down after less than one month on the job. Mr. Morton said in a company statement that "he has no disagreements with Tesla's leadership or its financial reporting." Chief people officer Gaby Toledano also left the company.</p>
<p>Friday's decline in Tesla's stock and benchmark bond issue is evidence investors don't quite believe that statement (though CEO Elon Musk's apparent
  toking during an interview didn't help).</p>
<p>Mr. Morton's predecessor resigned in March after 18 months. Finance chief Jason Wheeler left the company after slightly more than one year on the job. Three resignations of finance executives don't make for an exodus, but investors should ask what scared them off.</p>
<p>Erratic behavior from Mr. Musk is one obvious reason. On Mr. Morton's second day on the job, Mr. Musk tweeted about a deal to take the company private, which quickly spurred a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.</p>
<p>If that didn't scare off Mr. Morton, was there something in Tesla's numbers that made him flee? Mr. Musk's promises of fast production 
 growth for the Model 3 are also under investigation by the SEC. Information about consumer deposits for the car--long a key part of the bull case for the stock--has been haphazard and incomplete.</p>
<p>Tesla does other things to flatter its financial performance. Production and deliveries of cars have surged in the final days of a quarter, and analysts at Bernstein asked in June whether Tesla's cars looked more profitable because the company was booking expenses elsewhere.</p>
<p>Shareholders may want to follow Mr. Morton out the door.</p>

<p>The price of Tesla's 5.3% bonds due in August 2025 traded at just over 83 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters, down from roughly 86 cents on Thursday. The yield rose to 8.689% from 8.07%.</p>
<p>Friday marked the bonds' second-biggest one-day decline on record, behind a March 28 fall prompted by a credit-rating downgrade from Moody's Investors Service and increased scrutiny of the company's semiautonomous driving system following a fatal crash involving one of its vehicles.</p>
<p>Dave Morton said in a securities filing Friday that his decision to step down as chief accounting officer after less than a month on the job stemmed from "the level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company" having exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>His departure comes at a time when Tesla is reeling from a series of incidents
  that have raised questions about the leadership of Mr. Musk, as the auto maker struggles to meet its production goals and continues to lose money and burn cash.</p>
<p>Adding to investor concern, Mr. Musk appeared to smoke marijuana during a live interview late Thursday, on "The Joe Rogan Experience," one of the world's most popular podcasts. In the interview, which was filmed, Mr. Musk spoke for more than 2&frac12; hours on topics ranging from the dangers of artificial intelligence to his use of Twitter.</p>
<p>"The judgment of the chief executive is coming under scrutiny," said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union. The entry of additional competitors and Tesla's failure to meet its goals are "certainly enough to cause investors to second-guess the company," he said.</p>
<p>Tesla is facing increasing competition from other auto makers that are developing their own lines of electric vehicles. Mercedes-Benz said Tuesday that it will start production next year on a line of electric SUVs.</p>
<p>Prices of Tesla's only unsecured bond, a $1.8 billion note issued last August with a 5.3% coupon, have fallen since Mr. Musk first tweeted his interest in a go-private transaction
  last month. Shares were trading at about $360 and the bonds yielding about 7% before Mr. Musk's Aug. 7 statement on Twitter that he had secured funding to take the company private at a price of $420 a share. He has since given up the idea.</p>
<p>How the company fares in the debt market is important because it faces looming cash needs and has shown reluctance in recent years to issue new shares, as opposed to various types of bonds.</p>
<p>Tesla reported $2.2 billion of cash at the end of the second quarter, along with $9.5 billion in long-term debt and capital leases. Over the past year, the company burned through roughly $2.4 billion of cash, with interest expense totaling $577 million, according to the research firm CreditSights.</p>

  places the spotlight on the high turnover of executives at the electric car maker, and the challenges it could face in attracting and retaining talent amid regulatory scrutiny and recent controversial actions of its founder.</p>
<p>More than 50 executives have departed the company during the past 24 months
 . Chief Accounting Officer Dave Morton is among the latest. "The level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations. As a result, this caused me to reconsider my future," said Mr. Morton in securities filing. He didn't respond to a request for comment. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment beyond the company's regulatory filing.</p>
<p>A Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into whether Tesla misled investors over production problems with its Model 3 sedan, in addition to the concerns about the rate of executive turnover and Mr. Musk's recent actions would likely cause top-tier candidates to think twice if approached to fill executive roles at the company, executive recruiters said.</p>
<p>"In a market like this, where there's very high demand and people don't need to leave, if you have anything that causes concern or sensitivity at the top, the candidate pool goes, 'Whoa, I don't need that,'" said Peter Crist, chairman of executive recruiter Crist | Kolder Associates.</p>
<p>Tesla, in its filing, said accounting functions and personnel would be overseen by its Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja and its corporate controller, "as had been the cases prior to and during Dave's transition to Tesla."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has said that executive turnover at the company is in line with that of other large companies and has announced plans for a reorganization
  aimed at flattening the layers of managers. On Friday afternoon, he announced a slew of promotions in an email to employees. Tesla has hired new talent in recent months. The company in May announced eight executive hires, including new CFO for China, James Zhou, who had joined from Ingersoll-Rand PLC.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton's tenure at Tesla coincided with an unusual bout of public scrutiny. He joined the company on Aug. 6, one day before Chief Executive Elon Musk used social media to float the prospect of taking Tesla private. The message on Twitter triggered 
 gyrations in Tesla's stock and sparked a SEC investigation. Meanwhile, Mr. Musk's behavior continues to draw concern: on Thursday, he appeared to smoke marijuana
  during a live interview in which he spoke on wide-ranging topics for more than 2 1/2 hours.</p>
<p>Finance professionals, typically cautious by nature, place a lot of weight on reputation. Especially accountants, who often follow strict professional ethics codes. The chief accounting officer is often in charge of certifying a company financials to regulators, though Tesla's Mr. Morton brief tenure suggests he had yet to take on those responsibilities.</p>
<p>"The finance community, by nature, they're risk averse," Mr. Crist said. "If you're a CFO and somebody is coming after you with an opportunity, you're going to do a pretty deep risk assessment of the situation, because you don't want to have happen what happened today, it's just easier to say 'no thanks.'" Tesla's share price approached its 2018 low on Friday.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton's predecessor resigned in March after 18 months. Also, CFO Jason Wheeler left Tesla in early 2017 after less than two years in the role. He was succeeded by Deepak Ahuja, a company veteran who returned from retirement.</p>
<p>Tesla's challenges to attract and retain finance staff aren't without precedent, and going without leadership in key finance roles doesn't necessarily spell a crisis for a company.</p>
<p>Uber Technologies Inc. last month filled its CFO post
 , which had been vacant since 2015. The ride-hailing services company in early 2016 said it wasn't looking for a CFO. But the search was launched in earnest shortly after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi came on board in 2017,
  replacing founder Travis Kalanick who left under a cloud of scandals.</p>
<p>Mr. Khosrowshahi's arrival at the helm of Uber likely helped drive a positive outcome for the company, Mr. Crist said. "If you're talking about building a finance organization, you're always talking about who's at the top, who's going to bring the talent in," he said.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Khosrowshahi faced his own setback. He had hoped to reach an agreement with VMware Inc. CFO Zane Rowe for the long-vacant job, but Mr. Rowe indicated he would turn it down
 , The Wall Street Journal reported in May. A spokesman for Uber declined to comment.</p>
<p>Candidates considering a role with a company like Tesla or Uber can ask for "danger money," said Mark Freebairn, head of the financial management practice at recruitment firm Odgers Berndtson.</p>
<p>"These businesses will have to be flexible to attract the level of talent they want," he said. "If they want someone really badly, they will have to offer a package that compensates for the potential risk to their reputation."</p>
<p>Finance executives prize their reputation above anything else, he said.</p>
<p>"Elon could blow up that business now, in five minutes, today, in a year--and you as accounting or finance chief are tied to that," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Freebairn said he struggled to place former Tesco PLC finance staff member after the company's 2014 accounting scandal
 . "Every time I put forward someone from Tesco, I got questions about a potential involvement in the accounting issues," Mr. Freebairn said. The U.K. grocer in September 2014 announced it had overstated profit by &pound;263 million ($340.5 million).</p>
<p>The SEC last year began investigating whether Tesla misled investors about its Model 3 car production problems, The Wall Street Journal reported in August
 . The probe was launched before regulators started looking into Mr. Musk's tweets about taking the company private.</p>

The message on Twitter triggered gyrations in Tesla's stock and sparked a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.</p>
<p>The SEC last year began investigating whether Tesla misled investors about its Model 3 car production problems, The Wall Street Journal reported in August
 . That probe was launched before regulators started looking into Mr. Musk's tweets about taking the company private.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Musk's behavior continues to draw concern: on Thursday, he appeared to smoke marijuana during a live interview in which he spoke on wide-ranging topics for more than 2 &frac12; hours.</p>
<p>These issues would likely cause quality candidates to think twice if approached to fill executive roles at the company, executive recruiters said.</p>
<p>"In a market like this, where there's very high demand and people don't need to leave, if you have anything that causes concern or sensitivity at the top, the candidate pool goes, 'Whoa, I don't need that,'" said Peter Crist, chairman of executive recruiter Crist | Kolder Associates.</p>
<p>Tesla, in its filing, said accounting functions and personnel would be overseen by its Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja and its corporate controller, "as had been the cases prior to and during Dave's transition to Tesla."</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has said that executive turnover at the company is in line with that of other large companies and has announced plans for a reorganization
  aimed at flattening the layers of managers. On Friday afternoon, he announced a slew of promotions in an email to employees. Tesla has also hired new talent in recent months, naming eight new executives, including a new CFO for China, James Zhou, who had joined from Ingersoll-Rand PLC.</p>
<p>A chief accounting officer is often in charge of certifying financial statements that are submitted to regulators, which means ensuring the books are above reproach. Tesla's Mr. Morton brief tenure suggests he had not fully taken on those responsibilities.</p>
<p>The cautious, reputation-conscious nature of finance professionals could complicate the recruitment of Mr. Morton's replacement. Accountants often follow strict professional ethics codes and may worry about working for a company that is being investigated by the SEC -- regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p>"The finance community, by nature, they're risk averse," Mr. Crist said. "If you're a CFO and somebody is coming after you with an opportunity, you're going to do a pretty deep risk assessment of the situation, because you don't want to have happen what happened today, it's just easier to say 'no thanks.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Morton's predecessor resigned in March after 18 months. Former CFO Jason Wheeler left Tesla in early 2017 after less than two years in the role. He was succeeded by Mr. Ahuja, a company veteran who returned from retirement.</p>
<p>Such moves aren't without precedent, and going without leadership in key finance roles doesn't necessarily spell a crisis for a company.</p>
<p>Uber Technologies Inc. last month filled its CFO post
 , which had been vacant since 2015. The ride-hailing services company in early 2016 said it wasn't looking for a CFO. But the search was launched in earnest shortly after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi came on board in 2017,
  replacing founder Travis Kalanick who left under a cloud of scandals.</p>
<p>Mr. Khosrowshahi's arrival at the helm of Uber likely helped drive a positive outcome for the company, Mr. Crist said. "If you're talking about building a finance organization, you're always talking about who's at the top, who's going to bring the talent in," he said.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Khosrowshahi faced his own setback. He had hoped to reach an agreement with VMware Inc. CFO Zane Rowe for the long-vacant job, but Mr. Rowe indicated he would turn it down
 , The Wall Street Journal reported in May. A spokesman for Uber declined to comment.</p>
<p>Candidates considering a role with a company like Tesla or Uber can ask for "danger money," said Mark Freebairn, head of the financial management practice at recruitment firm Odgers Berndtson.</p>
<p>"These businesses will have to be flexible to attract the level of talent they want," he said. "If they want someone really badly, they will have to offer a package that compensates for the potential risk to their reputation."</p>
<p>Finance executives prize their reputation above anything else, he said.</p>
<p>"Elon could blow up that business now, in five minutes, today, in a year--and you as accounting or finance chief are tied to that," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Freebairn said he struggled to place former Tesco PLC finance staff member after the company's 2014 accounting scandal
 . "Every time I put forward someone from Tesco, I got questions about a potential involvement in the accounting issues," Mr. Freebairn said. The U.K. grocer in September 2014 announced it had overstated profit by &pound;263 million ($340.5 million).</p>

<p>Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management owns about 38,000 shares of Tesla Inc. valued at roughly $10 million at Friday's closing price of $263.24. A Page One article on Saturday about Tesla CEO Elon Musk incorrectly said the value of the stake was roughly $1 million.</p>
<p>(WSJ Sept. 10, 2018)</p>
<p>Tesla Inc.'s share price sank to near its lowest point for the year Friday after the electric-car maker lost more executives and Chief Executive Elon Musk appeared to smoke marijuana during an interview streamed on the web.</p>
<p>Dave Morton, the chief accounting officer touted by Tesla in late July as part of "key new talent" hired after a spell of executive departures, said Friday in a filing that he left because the public attention on the company and its pace were too much. Tesla also confirmed that Gabrielle Toledano, its head of human resources, wouldn't rejoin Tesla after her leave of absence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Musk's actions in a late-night interview with comedian Joe Rogan -- drinking whiskey and revealing a personal side of himself -- was another example of the CEO's unorthodox style that has won him legions of fans. But some analysts and investors say his erratic behavior is creating distractions for the company and its employees.</p>
<p>"We believe evidence is becoming more clear that Tesla needs to entertain a major change in the C-Suite," Jamie Albertine, an analyst for Consumer Edge, wrote in a report Friday. "The ongoing, effectively self-inflicted public relations crisis is now affecting key personnel within the organization."</p>
<p>Tesla's shares on Friday fell 6.3% to $263.24, approaching its 52-week low of $244.59. They are down 31% since Aug. 7 when Mr. Musk declared in a tweet that he had funding secured to take the company private at $420 a share.</p>
<p>Tesla's bonds, meanwhile, had their second-biggest one-day decline on record. "The judgment of the chief executive is coming under scrutiny," said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union.</p>
<p>Later on Friday, Mr. Musk announced in a memo to employees several high-level promotions, including installing veteran Tesla manager Jerome Guillen as president of automotive. The newly created position could help bolster leadership in manufacturing and relieve some of the day-to-day pressure on Mr. Musk, who had taken direct control of these areas earlier this year.</p>
<p>"For awhile, there will be a lot of fuss and noise in the media," Mr. Musk wrote in the memo posted on Tesla's website. "Just ignore them. Results are what matter."</p>
<p>The latest events further test a company that is dealing with the fallout from Mr. Musk's abandoned attempt to take it private, pressure to meet key production goals, concerns over its cash position and questions about the CEO's behavior.</p>
<p>Some of Tesla's supportive investors were chagrined by Mr. Musk's latest antics. He "gave the short sellers another life," Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management, said on Twitter early Friday. "Creating a totally unnecessary crisis of confidence. Even as they report incredible growth in operating numbers." His firm owns about 38,000 Tesla shares worth roughly $1 million.</p>
<p>In an email before Mr. Musk's Friday afternoon memo, Mr. Gerber said Mr. Musk at least appeared happy in the interview, countering a narrative that he is personally struggling. "I'm just not happy the [board of directors] is not announcing executives being added to support Tesla," he said. "They need someone solid for perception ASAP."</p>
<p>Mr. Morton, the departing accounting chief, said he had "no disagreements with Tesla's leadership or its financial reporting," and that he still believed in "Tesla, its mission and its future prospects."</p>
<p>He and Ms. Toledano joined other notable executives who have left Tesla this year, including engineering chief Doug Field, who ended up at Apple Inc., and sales and marketing president John McNeill, who went to the ride-hailing service Lyft Inc. Ms. Toledano's decision was earlier reported by Bloomberg.</p>
<p>More than 50 vice presidents or higher have left the company in the past two years. Mr. Musk has said he sees executive turnover as being in line with that of other large companies and has announced plans for a reorganization aimed at flattening the layers of managers.</p>
<p>Amid Tesla's difficulties, Mr. Musk took a break on Thursday night to appear on the popular podcast, "The Joe Rogan Experience," which is streamed live on YouTube and hosted by Mr. Rogan. The interview, which lasted more than 2 1/2 hours and stretched past midnight, was provocative, at times turning personal. The entrepreneur, wearing a black T-shirt with the words "Occupy Mars," expressed his concerns about the dangers of artificial intelligence, explored his vision for an electric supersonic airplane and said his brain is a "never-ending explosion of ideas."</p>
<p>Near the end, Mr. Rogan lighted what he said was "marijuana inside of tobacco" and asked Mr. Musk if he had ever smoked marijuana before.</p>
<p>"I think I tried one once," Mr. Musk said, laughing. "You probably can't because of stockholders, right?" Mr. Rogan asked. "I mean, it's legal, right?" Mr. Musk said. "Totally legal," Mr. Rogan replied. The interview was filmed in the Los Angeles metro area, where marijuana is allowed under state law.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk then put the marijuana cigarette to his mouth and took one puff before handing it back. He said he "almost never" smokes it and that he didn't feel an effect.</p>
<p>"I know a lot of people like weed -- and that's fine -- but I don't find that it is very useful for productivity," Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk has drawn attention recently for his occasional public outbursts. In the past few months, he has lashed out at analysts on a quarterly conference call for asking "boring, bonehead" questions, suggested on Twitter that a British cave explorer was a pedophile, and on Aug. 7 declared he had secured funding to take Tesla private when it later was revealed he was still trying to line up investors to propose a deal.</p>
<p>Following the spell of erratic behavior, some investors and analysts have questioned Mr. Musk's fitness as CEO. Friends and family say they are concerned Mr. Musk is fatigued and overworked. Mr. Musk has talked about struggling with sleep and his use of the sleeping drug Ambien. When the drug doesn't work, weariness saps his productivity the next day, according to a person familiar with his usage.</p>
<p>Last month, singer Azealia Banks suggested on Instagram that Mr. Musk used LSD while tweeting. A spokesperson for Mr. Musk called that claim "complete nonsense." Ms. Banks, who later apologized, made the accusation in the days after Mr. Musk's going-private tweet.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk scrapped the idea 16 days later and now faces an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission into whether he misled investors. The Tesla board wasn't happy with Mr. Musk's use of Twitter and has told him to be more careful, a person familiar with the matter previously told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Regarding his thoughts on Twitter, Mr. Musk said in the interview he tries to ignore most negative comments "but every now and again, you get drawn in. It's not good. You can make mistakes."</p>

<p>Tesla, celebrated for its ultrafast electric cars, is becoming known for executive departures that are just as speedy.</p>
<p>The company announced Friday morning that Chief Accounting Officer Dave Morton had stepped down after less than one month on the job. Mr. Morton said in a company statement that "he has no disagreements with Tesla's leadership or its financial reporting." Chief people officer Gaby Toledano also left the company.</p>
<p>Friday's decline in Tesla's stock is evidence investors don't quite believe that statement (though CEO Elon Musk's apparent toking during an interview didn't help).</p>
<p>Mr. Morton's predecessor resigned in March after 18 months. Finance chief Jason Wheeler left after slightly more than one year on the job. Three resignations of finance executives don't make for an exodus, but investors should ask what scared them off.</p>
<p>Erratic behavior from Mr. Musk is one obvious reason. On Mr. Morton's second day on the job, Mr. Musk tweeted about a deal to take Tesla private, which quickly spurred a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.</p>
<p>If that didn't scare off Mr. Morton, was there something in Tesla's numbers that made him flee? Mr. Musk's promises of fast production growth for the Model 3 are also under SEC investigation. Information about consumer deposits for the car has been haphazard and incomplete.</p>
<p>Tesla does other things to flatter its financial performance. Production and deliveries of cars have surged at the end of a quarter, and Bernstein analysts asked in June whether Tesla's cars looked more profitable because the company was booking expenses elsewhere.</p>
<p>Shareholders may want to follow Mr. Morton out the door.</p>

<p>CBS Corp.--Up 3.1%: CBS Chairman and Chief Executive Leslie Moonves is stepping down
  amid accusations that he sexually harassed and assaulted numerous women over his career.</p>
<p>Snap Inc.--Down 1.3%: Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan will leave the social media company

<p>Apple Inc.--Up 0.3%: Apple on Wednesday plans to announce two new models
  with its largest iPhone screens ever, The Wall Street Journal reported. Meanwhile, President Trump urged Apple to shift production to the U.S.

<p>Nike Inc.--Up 1.1%: Wedbush analysts raised their price target for the sportswear company to $90 from $85, citing global sales momentum and opportunities for accelerating demand in North America.

 .</p>
<p>Tesla Inc.--Up 3.2%: Tesla shares have dropped in 10 of the last 12 sessions to their lowest level since April 2, with Friday's 6.3% dip coming after the electric-car maker lost more executives and Chief Executive Elon Musk was seen appearing to smoke marijuana
  during an interview. The company announced more management changes late Friday.</p>
<p>Alphabet Inc.--Up 0.6%: Google this week will appeal an order to extend the European Union's "right to be forgotten"
  to its search engines across the globe, arguing before the EU's top court that the order encourages countries to assert sovereignty beyond their borders.</p>
<p>Akamai Technologies Inc.--Up 2.2%: DA Davidson upgraded Akamai Technologies to buy from neutral, citing increased demand and interest in its security products, with cloud security now accounting for a quarter of the company's business.</p>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices Inc.--Up 2.6%: Advanced Micro Devices shares have maintained gains over the past three months, and Susquehanna analysts said the semiconductor company is continuing to gain share in both desktops and laptops.</p>

<p>The startup, backed by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., had to contend with a difficult market environment in launching its initial public offering. Shares in rival car makers have slumped and Chinese stocks have been buffeted by concerns about growth, trade and currency weakness.</p>
<p>"We had actually a healthy book and then some orders got pulled or reduced because of market conditions," NIO's chief financial officer, Louis Hsieh, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Hsieh said investors were also wary that the company didn't have a long operating history, which he called a "fair criticism."</p>
<p>American depositary receipts of NIO closed 5.4% higher than the company's IPO price of $6.26 after spending much of the morning in the red. The stock traded down as much as 15% earlier Wednesday. At its IPO price, the company was valued at about $6.4 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Hsieh said if NIO meets two milestones--delivering 10,000 vehicles to customers in 2018 and launching a smaller family sport-utility vehicle--in the next six to nine months, he expects investor enthusiasm will be bolstered.</p>
<p>At $6.26 per ADR, the IPO would yield proceeds of $1 billion, before subtracting the costs of the share sale. Mr. Hsieh said NIO needs the capital to build its own manufacturing plant in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After $2.4 billion was raised in four rounds of financing, the public markets were a less dilutive choice for NIO, Mr. Hsieh said. The company also weighed listing in Hong Kong but ultimately opted for the U.S. for its "deeper, more transparent investor base" and the option to list alongside its main peer, Tesla, he said.</p>
<p>The offering size falls short of NIO's earlier target of $2 billion to $3 billion
  as reported by The Wall Street Journal. More recently the company had set an indicative price range
  of $6.25 to $8.25 a share.</p>
<p>The car maker, which was founded by Chinese entrepreneur Bin Li in 2014, has yet to generate much revenue, reporting $7 million of sales in the first half of 2018.</p>
<p>The fundraising is also a test of investors' confidence in the development of electric cars in the world's biggest automobile market. Shares in Chinese rival BYD Co. have fallen 36% this year in Hong Kong, compared with the benchmark Hang Seng Index's 12% decline.</p>
<p>China's car sales in August dropped for the second month in a row, according to the state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Analysts blamed the decline on a combination of market saturation and weak consumer confidence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tighter scrutiny of Tesla's production capability
  and Chief Executive Elon Musk's short-lived attempt to take the U.S. electric-car maker private have sent its shares down more than one-fifth since Aug. 7, when Mr. Musk tweeted about the privatization.</p>
<p>Mr. Hsieh said his company has been hiring many former Tesla employees and they have fit in quickly. "We have been able to pick up a lot of quality talent." Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Late last year, NIO launched its first mass-produced car, a seven-seat electric sport-utility vehicle. It plans to start delivering a second, smaller SUV in the first half of 2019.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co led Wednesday's offering.</p>

<p>The startup, backed by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., had to contend with a difficult market environment in launching its initial public offering. Shares in rival car makers have slumped and Chinese stocks have been buffeted by concerns about growth, trade and currency weakness.</p>
<p>"We had actually a healthy book and then some orders got pulled or reduced because of market conditions," NIO's chief financial officer, Louis Hsieh, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Hsieh said investors were also wary that the company didn't have a long operating history, which he called a "fair criticism."</p>
<p>American depositary receipts of NIO closed 5.4% higher than the company's IPO price of $6.26 after spending much of the morning in the red. The stock traded down as much as 15% earlier Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>At its IPO price, the company was valued at about $6.4 billion.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co led Wednesday's offering.</p>

Its sky-high valuation, however, makes even Elon Musk's company look like a bargain.</p>
<p>Counting after-hours trading, the share price almost doubled Thursday, two days after the electric-vehicle maker raised $1 billion from an initial public offering
  on the New York Stock Exchange. That lifted NIO's market value to $14 billion, topping the likes of Korea's Kia Motor and Japan's Mazda Motor.</p>
<p>The appeal is clear: NIO makes high-performance cars
  and China is the biggest EV market in the world. The government has been that market's major driving force, and investors are betting that NIO could become Beijing's chosen national champion. The star-studded lineup of backers includes Chinese technology giants Tencent and Baidu, as well as veteran investors Sequoia and Hillhouse Capital.</p>
<p>But the stock now looks a risky bet. NIO has been generating revenue for only a few months, having started delivering its sole model, the ES8--a seven-passenger sport-utility vehicle with an all-aluminum body--in June. With a price around half that of Tesla's Model X, it is a money loser for NIO, which burned through $712 million in the first half of the year. At that rate, the company could use up its $1.7 billion of cash on hand by next year--and the pace of the cash burn will likely pick up as it produces more cars.</p>
<p>Reservations and deliveries for the ES8 about match those of the then-new Model S in 2012, according to Bernstein. But at that time Tesla's market value was only around $4 billion.</p>
<p>Tesla's current enterprise value equates to 1.8 times its expected 2020 sales, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. For NIO, that ratio would translate to $7 billion in revenue in two years, suggesting a production pace of 110,000 cars a year--a very ambitious target for a company that last month delivered 1,121 and generated only $7 million in revenue in the first half.</p>
<p>And NIO didn't even make those cars. Its plants are still under construction and it lacks the required manufacturing licenses, so for now it relies on a state-owned car maker for production. And where Tesla had a head start--it pioneered the high-performance EV market, building a cult following along the way--NIO faces abundant competition from other startups, like Alibaba-backed Xiaopeng Motors, as well as traditional car makers from BMW to Volvo. And Tesla, of course.</p>
<p>Investors should get off the stock when it's still moving fast.</p>

<p>The original Tesla was in some ways a strange choice to be a namesake for a company looking to overcome obstacles and achieve groundbreaking business success. True, he pioneered many of technologies that still power and light the world (alternating current, the electric induction motor, fluorescent and neon bulbs), and he was awarded more than 300 patents.</p>
<p>But Tesla died virtually penniless in a New York hotel room in 1943, after failing to capitalize on his major innovations while others won fortunes and Nobel Prizes by building on his work. Until the revival of Tesla's name in recent years, it had sunk into near-obscurity except among electrical engineers.</p>
<p>Where did this patron saint of innovation go wrong? The disappointing career of the Serbian-born engineer is a cautionary tale, highlighting destructive habits and tendencies that kept him from realizing his most ambitious projects.</p>
<p>Lone-wolf behavior: Tesla frequently left jobs over disputes and didn't build a lasting, loyal team around him. After starting his career as chief electrician for the Budapest telephone exchange in 1881, he got his big break by being asked to fix power plants in Paris for Thomas Edison's company. The firm brought him to New York City, but he soon quit because of a disagreement about his bonus.</p>
<p>While trying to interest American investors in his idea of an alternating-current (AC) motor, he started a Tesla company of his own, making arc lamps, which were already nearly obsolete predecessors to the incandescent bulb. The older technology didn't hold his interest and his investors forced him out, with only worthless stock certificates in hand.</p>
<p>Lack of follow-up: Early on, Tesla tended to flit among projects. He never stuck around long enough to reap rewards, leaving credit and opportunities to others. Around 1890, he designed the basic circuits for a radio apparatus, which he called an oscillator. He applied for patents and demonstrated a radio-controlled boat in Madison Square Garden, but he failed to commercialize these innovations. Guglielmo Marconi would be recognized for inventing radio and won the 1909 Nobel Prize for related research. The Supreme Court eventually awarded the foundational patents to Tesla, vindicating his work, but only after his death.</p>
<p>In 1894, Tesla also experimented with X-rays and produced what he called "shadowgraphs." But he took that work no further and instead sent his images to the German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen, who was also working on the technology. Roentgen published his own findings the next year and eventually won the first Nobel Prize for physics.</p>
<p>Financial naivet&eacute;: The industrialist George Westinghouse financed the building of Tesla's motor and alternating current system, buying Tesla's patents in exchange for a lucrative royalty agreement. Tesla showcased the technology at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 and again at the power station he designed at Niagara Falls, the world's first major hydroelectric plant. But when the enormous cost of the wiring threatened to bankrupt Westinghouse, Tesla tore up the royalty contract, which would have made him one of the richest men in the world. He was never able to replace it and lacked the capital to sustain his later projects.</p>
<p>Increasing tunnel vision: Tesla ultimately devoted most of his efforts to a wireless transmitting project that never proved out. He bought land in 1901 and began building a lab and a nearly 200-foot tower near Shoreham, N.Y. But in a few years he burned through his investors' initial funds and his own. By his own admission, writing in 1919, he "suffered a complete collapse" when he ran out of resources for the project. Eventually, his tower was torn down and sold for scrap to help pay his outstanding hotel bill at the Waldorf Astoria.</p>

<p>NIO, China's answer to Tesla, is off to an electrifying start. Its sky-high valuation, however, makes even Elon Musk's company look like a bargain.</p>
<p>Counting after-hours trading, the share price almost doubled Thursday, two days after the electric-vehicle maker raised $1 billion from an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. That lifted NIO's market value to $14 billion, topping the likes of Korea's Kia Motor and Japan's Mazda Motor.</p>
<p>Investors are betting NIO could become Beijing's chosen national EV champion. But the stock looks risky. NIO has generated revenue for only a few months and only began delivering its sole model in June. With a price around half that of Tesla's Model X, it is a money loser. NIO could burn through its cash on hand by next year.</p>
<p>Reservations and deliveries about match those of the then-new Model S in 2012, according to Bernstein. But back then Tesla's market value was just $4 billion. Tesla's current enterprise value equates to 1.8 times expected 2020 sales. For NIO, that would translate to $8 billion in revenue in two years, suggesting output of 110,000 cars -- an ambitious target for a company that last month delivered 1,121.</p>
<p>And NIO didn't even make them. Its plants remain under construction so it relies on a state-owned car maker. And, where Tesla had a head start, NIO faces abundant competition from other startups like Xiaopeng Motor, as well as traditional car makers from BMW to Volvo.</p>
<p>Investors should hop off NIO while it is still accelerating.</p>

Musk's influence and wealth cannot convert his lies into truth or protect him from accountability for his wrongdoing in a court of law," L. Lin Wood, an Atlanta-based attorney who is part of Mr. Unsworth's legal team, said in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>Mr. Unsworth seeks compensatory damages of more than $75,000 and an unspecified amount of punitive damages in the suit. He also is asking for an injunction that would prevent Mr. Musk from publishing further "false and defamatory accusations."</p>
<p>The lawsuit says that Mr. Musk was "apparently angered" by Mr. Unsworth's criticism, on July 13, of Mr. Musk's suggestion to use a mini-submarine to save the boys, who were trapped in a complex cave system in Thailand and faced rising waters, according to the suit.</p>
<p>On July 15, Mr. Musk published a tweet
  that referenced Mr. Unsworth as a "pedo guy." He soon deleted that tweet and apologized for writing it
 .</p>
<p>"Although Musk's 'apology' to Mr. Unsworth stated that his accusations were not justified and were made out of anger, the 'apology' significantly did not disavow or retract his accusations of pedophilia against Mr. Unsworth," the diver's lawsuit says.</p>
<p>On Aug. 28, meanwhile, Mr. Musk published another tweet
  that said in part, "You don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me? He was offered free legal services...." That tweet conveyed to readers that Mr. Unsworth's failure, at that point, to sue him was evidence Mr. Unsworth was a pedophile and guilty of crimes, according to the suit.</p>
<p>Two days later, Mr. Musk wrote an email to a BuzzFeed News reporter that "confirmed his previous accusations of pedophilia and published new false and defamatory accusations," against Mr. Unsworth, the lawsuit claims. The accusations included that Mr. Unsworth was a child rapist, had married a 12-year-old girl, engaged in sex trafficking and other crimes.</p>
<p>In a second email to a BuzzFeed reporter, Mr. Musk falsely accused Mr. Unsworth of "being a liar and falsely states he was banned from the rescue site," according to the suit.</p>

<p>The consumer-products consultant is selling his Tesla Model 3 sedan and replacing it with a Jaguar I-Pace, a new sport-utility vehicle arriving in a few weeks that, he said, has a romantic British sports-car heritage, luxurious interior--and runs on electricity.</p>
<p>"I mean a Jag--how could you not?" said the 60-year-old from St. Petersburg, Fla. "You sit in any one of them. It is just the lap of luxury."</p>
<p>The I-Pace, which starts at about $70,000 and arrives in U.S. showrooms this fall, represents the first of a long-promised assault by European luxury auto makers to challenge Tesla with their own high-end, long-range electric vehicles. They are gunning for one of America's most popular vehicle categories: SUVs.</p>
<p>On Monday in the San Francisco area, German auto maker Audi AG revealed the production version of its electric SUV called the e-tron. It aims to begin selling the spacious, five-seater in the U.S. next spring starting at about $75,000, slightly less than the roughly $80,000 base price of Tesla's Model X SUV.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz revealed its own electric SUV, the EQC, that will begin production late next year, ahead of BMW AG's plans for an electric version of the X3 SUV in 2020.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, is widely credited for proving that electric cars can be sexy, creating a global luxury brand with a devoted following beyond environmentalists. But Tesla's yearslong head start is ending
  as a wave of auto makers plan to push out electric offerings over the coming months, spurred in part by regulatory standards calling for reduced tailpipe emissions.</p>
<p>Tesla rolled out the Model X three years ago and it doesn't plan to start production of its next SUV until the second half of 2020 at the earliest. That vehicle, the Model Y, will be a compact SUV, smaller than the roomy, midsize versions from the European companies.</p>
<p>The new competitors will be greeted in the U.S. with $7,500 federal tax credits for buyers of electric vehicles. Tesla's customers have enjoyed the tax credit, but it will begin to be phased out next year after the Silicon Valley auto maker reached the milestone of selling 200,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>And that could all weigh on Tesla's gross margins and future profitability, David Tamberrino, an analyst for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a note to clients this month.</p>
<p>Some analysts, however, expect the competition to help Tesla. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst for Stanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., said the new arrivals will "validate and expand" the electric car market. "Rather than competition, we believe Tesla's greatest threat is its own execution," he told investors in a note on Monday.</p>
<p>Tesla declined to comment.</p>
<p>The challengers are arriving as Tesla struggles to boost production of the Model 3 sedan, fueling doubts it will have the manufacturing prowess to churn out tens of thousands of cars a week as the incumbent auto makers do. At the same time, Tesla has weathered a storm of negative pub
 licity including high-level departures, crashes involving its vehicles using a semiautonomous driving system, and erratic behavior by Mr. Musk
 , including an abrupt, short-lived decision to take Tesla private.</p>
<p>The controversies offer an opportunity for traditional auto makers to lure potential buyers who are curious about electric vehicles but unsure about the Silicon Valley company, said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader.</p>
<p>"They're very familiar with a Mercedes badge, or an Audi badge or a Jaguar badge or a BMW badge," he said. "It will be a very interesting test case."</p>
<p>The European auto makers are seeking to stir excitement in Tesla's backyard. Audi on Monday night held an elaborate launch event in an old Ford assembly plant about an hour's drive from Tesla's factory. With the backdrop of San Francisco's skyline, and after a drone light show revealing Audi's four-ringed logo, the company took the wraps off the long-touted e-tron in front of hundreds of people</p>
<p>The five-seat midsize SUV boasts Audi's latest tech features such as two touch screens in the dash and an infotainment system featuring Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa voice assistant, and it can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 5.5 seconds, slightly less than the Model X's base model.</p>
<p>Audi on Monday touted its franchise dealership network--something Tesla doesn't have--as an advantage, enabling customers to get their cars fixed, receive next-day delivery of parts or a service loaner. "There are systems and processes that we know how to do," said Scott Keogh, president of Audi of America.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk on Sunday pledged to speed up repairs by bringing the service in-house, acknowledging in a tweet that it was taking weeks or months for Tesla owners to get their cars fixed at repair shops.</p>
<p>Next month in San Francisco, Jaguar Land Rover, the British unit of India's Tata Motors Ltd., begins a marketing tour in four U.S. cities that it thinks have the most potential early buyers.</p>
<p>"We are targeting current Tesla owners" as well as others interested in luxury electric vehicles, said Kim McCullough, vice president of marketing for Jaguar Land Rover's North America operations. "These buyers have options, they are affluent and they want to feel like they're not making sacrifices."</p>
<p>Previous attempts by established competitors
  to target Tesla have come up short. General Motors Co.'s plug-in Cadillac ELR, a $75,000 coupe, failed to garner a following and was shut down in 2016. Its Chevy Bolt, once considered a Tesla fighter
 , hasn't received the same kind of attention as Tesla's higher-end cars.</p>
<p>The German luxury brands, however, appear to be catching the eye of potential Tesla buyers. Those brands are among the most analyzed by people who are also researching Model Ss and Model Xs, according to automotive shopping website Edmunds.</p>
<p>Mr. Richmond bought a Model X a few years ago and said he likes some of the SUV's features, such as its quick acceleration. But he said he experienced quality issues like rattling, air leaks and misaligned doors that shouldn't be in a car priced over $100,000.</p>
<p>"The value proposition I think has waned a little bit," he said, adding, "they've kind milked this cow for a while and now they need to do something" new.</p>

<p>The company said that last month it received a "voluntary request for documents" from the Justice Department, generally the first step in a federal investigation of this kind. Tesla said it hasn't received a subpoena, a request for testimony or any other formal request.                                       </p>
<p>Tesla said it is cooperating with the probe. "We respect the DOJ's desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received," the company said in a statement.             </p>
<p>A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Bloomberg News earlier reported the Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation against Tesla.              </p>
<p>Shares of Tesla were down 3.2% in midday trading.             </p>
<p>On Aug. 7, Mr. Musk surprised investors
  when he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share, about 20% above the stock's trading price earlier that day. In his tweet, Mr. Musk said the buyout had "funding secured," without providing any details.              </p>
<p>Days later it was revealed that Mr. Musk was still lining up investors and funding for a proposed deal.              </p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating
  Mr. Musk's funding claim and subpoenaed Tesla seeking information from each of its directors. Some investors have sued Mr. Musk and the company, saying the CEO misled them and they lost money as a result.                          </p>
<p>A Justice Department investigation would likely be criminal because prosecutors often work in parallel with the SEC when there is an allegation of securities fraud, said Michael Liftik, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan LLP.             </p>
<p>"If there is a civil case to be brought, the SEC would bring it," said Mr. Liftik, a former SEC enforcement attorney. "If the conduct is such that it's so serious that the DOJ or the local U.S. attorney's office views it as potentially criminal, then they investigate the criminal side."              </p>
<p>The DOJ can use a variety of statues to prosecute criminal securities fraud, including the wire fraud statute, Mr. Liftik said. But prosecutors would have to show the misconduct was "knowing and willful," and not just reckless, he said.              </p>
<p>The go-private drama was one of several recent episodes
  that have caused some investors and analysts to question Mr. Musk's fitness as CEO.              </p>
<p>In July, he suggested on Twitter that a British cave explorer involved in rescuing a boys' soccer team in Thailand was a pedophile, a claim he later apologized for and then reiterated. The man filed a defamation lawsuit on Monday 
 against Mr. Musk. Tesla declined to comment, and Mr. Musk couldn't be reached.              </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tesla shares tumbled after Mr. Musk appeared to smoke marijuana during a late-night interview
  broadcast live on YouTube.              </p>
<p>Tesla has struggled for the past year to speed up production of its Model 3 sedan, placing Mr. Musk under intense scrutiny
  and raising questions about the company's finances. In June, Tesla met its oft-delayed production milestone of building 5,000 Model 3 cars in a single week, a threshold that if sustained could help the company toward its goal of becoming cash-flow positive and profitable in the third quarter.              </p>
<p>"We continue to believe fundamentals are strong headed into Q3 deliveries, but we acknowledge the noise around the stock makes it challenging to invest on fundamentals, currently," Ben Kallo, an analyst for Baird Equity Research, said Tuesday in a note.              </p>
<p>Tesla's stock jumped 11% on Aug. 7 following Mr. Musk's go-private tweets, which were sent during market hours. In the following days, Mr. Musk and Tesla's board raced to assemble teams of financial advisers
  and lawyers to help facilitate complex negotiations.              </p>
<p>On Aug. 23, Mr. Musk told the board he had decided not to follow through with a proposal. The next day, he ended the going-private talk
  by tweeting that "I believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public." Tesla directors released a statement at that time saying "we fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward."             </p>
<p>Since Aug. 7, Tesla's stock has fallen roughly 25% as prospects for a deal rose and fell. The shares are down roughly 8% this year after rising about 46% in 2017.             </p>

<p>The company said that last month it received a "voluntary request for documents" from the Justice Department, generally the first step in a federal investigation of this kind. Tesla said it hasn't received a subpoena, a request for testimony or any other formal request.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk's decision to tweet on Aug. 7 his plans to take Tesla private continues to hound the company. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating whether Mr. Musk misled investors, and some investors have sued Mr. Musk and Tesla, saying they lost money as a result of the public statements.</p>
<p>Tesla on Tuesday said it is cooperating with the Justice Department probe. "We respect the DOJ's desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received," the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Bloomberg News earlier reported the Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation against Tesla.</p>
<p>Shares of Tesla fell 3.4% to $284.96 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Aug. 7, Mr. Musk surprised investors when he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share, about 20% above the stock's trading price earlier that day. In his tweet, Mr. Musk said the buyout had "funding secured," without providing any details. Days later it was revealed that Mr. Musk was still lining up investors and funding for a proposed deal.</p>
<p>The SEC last month subpoenaed Tesla seeking information from each of its directors. The agency last year also began investigating whether Tesla misled investors about production problems with its Model 3 sedan, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p>
<p>A Justice Department investigation would likely be criminal because prosecutors often work in parallel with the SEC when there is an allegation of securities fraud, said Michael Liftik, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan LLP.</p>
<p>"If there is a civil case to be brought, the SEC would bring it," said Mr. Liftik, a former SEC enforcement attorney. "If the conduct is such that it's so serious that the DOJ or the local U.S. attorney's office views it as potentially criminal, then they investigate the criminal side."</p>
<p>The DOJ can use a variety of statues to prosecute criminal securities fraud, including the wire fraud statute, Mr. Liftik said. But prosecutors would have to show the misconduct was "knowing and willful," and not just reckless, he said.</p>
<p>The go-private drama was one of several recent episodes that have caused some investors and analysts to question Mr. Musk's fitness as CEO.</p>
<p>In July, he suggested on Twitter that a British cave explorer involved in rescuing a boys' soccer team in Thailand was a pedophile, a claim he later apologized for and then reiterated. The man filed a defamation lawsuit on Monday against Mr. Musk. Tesla declined to comment, and Mr. Musk couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tesla shares tumbled after Mr. Musk appeared to smoke marijuana during a late-night interview broadcast live on YouTube.</p>
<p>Tesla has struggled for the past year to speed up its Model 3 production, placing Mr. Musk under intense scrutiny and raising questions about the company's finances. In June, Tesla met its oft-delayed production milestone of building 5,000 Model 3 cars in a single week, a threshold that if sustained could help the company toward its goal of becoming cash-flow positive and profitable in the third quarter.</p>
<p>"We continue to believe fundamentals are strong headed into Q3 deliveries, but we acknowledge the noise around the stock makes it challenging to invest on fundamentals, currently," Ben Kallo, an analyst for Baird Equity Research, said Tuesday in a note.</p>
<p>Tesla's stock jumped 11% on Aug. 7 following Mr. Musk's go-private tweets. On Aug. 23, Mr. Musk told the board he had decided not to follow through with the proposal. The next day, he tweeted that "I believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public."</p>
<p>Since Aug. 7, Tesla's stock has fallen roughly 25% as prospects for a deal rose and fell. The shares are down about 8% this year after rising 46% in 2017.</p>

Stock movements reflect premarket trading.</p>
<p>Tesla Inc.--Down 1.8%: Tesla shares fell more than 3% on Tuesday, erasing recent gains after the company said the Justice Department has opened an investigation
  into the company following Chief Executive Elon Musk's surprise tweet in August that he had secured funding to possibly take the electric-car maker private.</p>
<p>LyondellBasell Industries NV--Down 2.6%: JPMorgan analysts downgraded the chemical company's stock to underweight, citing the recent rise in feedstock prices.</p>
<p>Prudential Financial Inc.--Up 1.8%: Prudential announced a series of leadership changes
 , including a new finance chief, about a week after the company said that its chief executive would step down.</p>
<p>McDonald's Corp.--Up 0.1%: European Union regulators said McDonald's tax arrangement in Luxembourg is legal, dropping an investigation 
 against the U.S. fast-food giant in contrast with a barrage of fines levied on American tech firms.
</p>
<p>Nike Inc.--Up 0.4%: Shares of the athletic apparel retailer have risen in six of the past seven sessions to a record, erasing declines from earlier this month that followed its decision to use National Football League quarterback-turned activist Colin Kaepernick
  at the center of an advertising campaign. Nike is scheduled to report earnings next week.</p>
<p>AbbVie Inc.--Down 0.7%: A California lawsuit filed late in Tuesday's session alleges the company made "illegal kickbacks" to health-care providers to encourage prescriptions of its drug Humira. Shares of AbbVie closed down 2.9%.</p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp.--Down 0.5%: Shares of energy companies are expected to swing alongside oil prices on weekly government inventory data slated to be released at 10:30 a.m. ET. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, late Tuesday reported that stockpiles rose unexpectedly last week.</p>
<p>AutoNation Inc.--Unchanged: Chief Executive Mike Jackson, who stood out in the tight-lipped auto industry for his outspoken personality and willingness to challenge auto makers publicly, will step down in 2019

<p>Not perfect--the lagging touch screen in my test car made me want to drive it off one of Monterey Peninsula's scenic cliffs--but still, pretty great. Two, but only two, car makers sell luxury electric crossovers now: Tesla and Jaguar Land Rover. One is American and one British, with a banker in India.</p>
<p>And the German Big Three, the industry's tech standard-bearers? Still bravely in their foxholes. Earlier this week VW Group's premium Audi division unveiled its e-tron electric SUV, with the first U.S. deliveries scheduled for Q2 of 2019. Porsche's all-electric four-door coupe, the Taycan, is probably a spring 2020 arrival (the company won't commit). Also this month, Mercedes-Benz pulled the silk off its new EQC electric SUV, expected to arrive stateside in 2020. And BMW showcased its Vision iNext concept--how's that for preliminary-sounding?--the fruit of which won't come to market until 2021.</p>
<p>Germans are usually so punctual.</p>
<p>JLR's jump on electrification has bought it a competitive advantage of roughly 18 months over every premium car maker that isn't Tesla. What good is that? Well, it's definitive for the brand, especially among the next generation of car buyers in Europe and particularly China, where the government is effectively regulating gas cars off the market.</p>
<p>Jaguar's ahead-of-the-curveness is also a matter of well-judged necessity. It's axiomatic that no company can catch Tesla if they don't first leave the gate.</p>
<p>Listen up, consumers: A lot of armchair quarterbacks have assumed that, whenever original equipment manufacturers pulled the trigger, their resources would allow them to overtake Tesla's intellectual property quickly. But with more players to compare, it's becoming obvious that Tesla's advantage in powertrain tech won't be so easily commodified or wished away.</p>
<p>For example: The new I-Pace matches the Tesla Model X 75D in range (around 240 miles) but it requires a 20% larger battery to do so. The Model X is also 14 inches longer and 400 pounds heavier, so a whole class above in size.</p>
<p>And then there is charging. At a Level 2 home charger, a dead-empty I-Pace would take 12.9 hours to fully charge, according to Jaguar. For the same car at a public DC fast-charger (50kW), 30 minutes would yield about 60 miles of extra range. That's assuming, in the moment of need, you can find convenient DC fast charging (the navi system will indicate these stations and help route-plan, if necessary). Chances are you'll drive past one or more of Tesla's hundreds of proprietary Supercharger stations along the way.</p>
<p>The deets: Assembled by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, the 4,784-pound compact crossover is built on a palpably stiff aluminum monocoque dressed in alloy body panels. Under its five seats, a floor-integrated liquid-cooled battery pack stores 90 kWh of energy. Overhead, the Jag's heavenly lightsource, the panoramic roof. Typical of EVs, the I-Pace's cab-forward floor plan is open but the dramatic roofline holds cargo capacity to a scant 51 cubic feet.</p>
<p>All-wheel drive comes by way of AC synchronous motors fore and aft with integrated single-speed transmissions, delivering a combined 394 hp and 512 lb-ft of ready torque, enough to toss the little British space pod to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and top out at 124 mph. At low speeds and low demand the rear motor does all the work in near silence of oiled electrons. The tire roar is by far the loudest thing. But when you boot the I-Pace to full power, it sings to you, a spiraling aria analogous to an internal combustion car's rising revs, coming out of the cabin loudspeakers. You can turn it off if you like, killjoy.</p>
<p>The I-Pace chassis is also well credentialed, with double-wishbone front suspension, integrated multilink in the rear, and standard air suspension with adaptive ride height. Weight distribution is almost exactly 50/50 and its center of gravity is Lamborghini-low.</p>
<p>All of which, plus its stance-laden width, give the I-Pace nice pointability and respectable sideways grip in balanced, steady-state cornering. In the foothills of Monterey I really had to torment the front Pirelli P Zeros to make them squeal. Central to this car's gestalt is the high level of regenerative braking effect. The car can use its motors to decelerate up to 0.04 g's before getting the brake pads involved. For most drivers this amounts to one-pedal driving, a sort of rheostatic response to the right-foot pressure. It's fun. For those who don't want to retrain, the Jag includes a light-regen mode with more familiar brake and throttle behavior.</p>
<p>It's clear the designers tried to avoid alienating consumers, a la the bone-chilling minimalism of a Tesla Model 3. Comparatively, the I-Pace UX looks like Mission Control with leather upholstery. There are a good number of physical rotary controllers, switches and ergonomic landmarks at hand, so you don't always have to go ferreting around its torpid touch screen.</p>
<p>Looks great, doesn't it? The contrasted trapezoids like folded-paper art? In one respect, though, I-Pace is a bit of a fashion victim. The exaggerated wheel arches accommodate optional, and audacious, 22-inchers, which is what our test car was wearing. They glam magnificently; but over rough road these biggie wheels trembled hard, even with air springs and adaptive suspension. It's just a bit much unsprung weight.</p>
<p>Still, Jag isn't letting perfect be the enemy of the good.</p>

I had my little Nissan Leaf for a long time, then finally my wife said: "Listen, stupid, just buy a Tesla." So I got the 2018 Tesla Model Xand I am very, very fond of it. I never know where I am, so the navigation is wonderful. I love the way the stereo sounds. I love how quiet it is. I'm told it goes fast, but there's a setting called Chill that stops it from going fast. I keep it on that one.</p>
<p>The constant hum of airplane engines used to drive me crazy. But my Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless II headphones have changed travel for me completely. They make a flight totally peaceful. I often don't listen to anything.</p>
<p>I have large vinyl collection and a Bang &amp; Olufsen Beogram 4002 turntable from the '70s--a really, really nice one. I don't listen to vinyl often. I also don't believe it sounds better. I think that's a lot of bad science. But I'm old enough that I like seeing a record turning on a turntable. Plus, you get to hold the album and read it again.</p>
<p>I always have a deck of cards on me. Tally-Ho No. 9, circle back. Always red. They feel the best in my hands. They're $6 a deck. I love them.</p>
<p>Lou Reed could just sit and touch his guitar. There was something sensual about it that connected with him. I never had that feeling until I got my first computer, a little 1985 Kaypro. My first week with it, I wrote five stories that were published. Now I love the iMac because I hate clutter. There's nothing on my desk except for it, an Amazon Echo and four drinking birds.</p>
<p>At home, I play a bright pink Quintus Stringed Instruments carbon fiber double bass. It has a really nice sound that's different from my wooden bass. It feels good to hold--modern and not delicate. That bright pink makes it look foolish, yet it's very tough and sounds wonderful.</p>

<p>Not perfect -- the lagging touch screen in my test car made me want to drive it off one of Monterey Peninsula's scenic cliffs -- but still, pretty great. Two, but only two, car makers sell luxury electric crossovers now: Tesla and Jaguar Land Rover. One is American and one British, with a banker in India.</p>
<p>And the German Big Three, the industry's tech standard-bearers? Still bravely in their foxholes. Earlier this week VW Group's premium Audi division unveiled its e-tron electric SUV, with the first U.S. deliveries scheduled for Q2 of 2019. Porsche's all-electric four-door coupe, the Taycan, is probably a spring 2020 arrival (the company won't commit). Also this month, Mercedes-Benz pulled the silk off its new EQC electric SUV, expected to arrive stateside in 2020. And BMW showcased its Vision iNext concept -- how's that for preliminary-sounding? -- the fruit of which won't come to market until 2021.</p>
<p>Germans are usually so punctual.</p>
<p>JLR's jump on electrification has bought it a competitive advantage of roughly 18 months over every premium car maker that isn't Tesla. What good is that? Well, it's definitive for the brand, especially among the next generation of car buyers in Europe and particularly China, where the government is effectively regulating gas cars off the market.</p>
<p>Jaguar's ahead-of-the-curveness is also a matter of well-judged necessity. It's axiomatic that no company can catch Tesla if they don't first leave the gate.</p>
<p>Listen up, consumers: A lot of armchair quarterbacks have assumed that, whenever original equipment manufacturers pulled the trigger, their resources would allow them to overtake Tesla's intellectual property quickly. But with more players to compare, it's becoming obvious that Tesla's advantage in powertrain tech won't be so easily commodified or wished away.</p>
<p>For example: The new I-Pace matches the Tesla Model X 75D in range (around 240 miles) but it requires a 20% larger battery to do so. The Model X is also 14 inches longer and 400 pounds heavier, so a whole class above in size.</p>
<p>And then there is charging. At a Level 2 home charger, a dead-empty I-Pace would take 12.9 hours to fully charge, according to Jaguar. For the same car at a public DC fast-charger (50kW), 30 minutes would yield about 60 miles of extra range. That's assuming, in the moment of need, you can find convenient DC fast charging (the navi system will indicate these stations and help route-plan, if necessary). Chances are you'll drive past one or more of Tesla's hundreds of proprietary Supercharger stations along the way.</p>
<p>The deets: Assembled by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, the 4,784-pound compact crossover is built on a palpably stiff aluminum monocoque dressed in alloy body panels. Under its five seats, a floor-integrated liquid-cooled battery pack stores 90 kWh of energy. Overhead, the Jag's heavenly lightsource, the panoramic roof. Typical of EVs, the I-Pace's cab-forward floor plan is open but the dramatic roofline holds cargo capacity to a scant 51 cubic feet.</p>
<p>All-wheel drive comes by way of AC synchronous motors fore and aft with integrated single-speed transmissions, delivering a combined 394 hp and 512 lb-ft of ready torque, enough to toss the little British space pod to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and top out at 124 mph. At low speeds and low demand the rear motor does all the work in near silence of oiled electrons. The tire roar is by far the loudest thing. But when you boot the I-Pace to full power, it sings to you, a spiraling aria analogous to an internal combustion car's rising revs, coming out of the cabin loudspeakers. You can turn it off if you like, killjoy.</p>
<p>The I-Pace chassis is also well credentialed, with double-wishbone front suspension, integrated multilink in the rear, and standard air suspension with adaptive ride height. Weight distribution is almost exactly 50/50 and its center of gravity is Lamborghini-low.</p>
<p>All of which, plus its stance-laden width, give the I-Pace nice pointability and respectable sideways grip in balanced, steady-state cornering. In the foothills of Monterey I really had to torment the front Pirelli P Zeros to make them squeal. Central to this car's gestalt is the high level of regenerative braking effect. The car can use its motors to decelerate up to 0.04 g's before getting the brake pads involved. For most drivers this amounts to one-pedal driving, a sort of rheostatic response to the right-foot pressure. It's fun. For those who don't want to retrain, the Jag includes a light-regen mode with more familiar brake and throttle behavior.</p>
<p>It's clear the designers tried to avoid alienating consumers, a la the bone-chilling minimalism of a Tesla Model 3. Comparatively, the I-Pace UX looks like Mission Control with leather upholstery. There are a good number of physical rotary controllers, switches and ergonomic landmarks at hand, so you don't always have to go ferreting around its torpid touch screen.</p>
<p>Looks great, doesn't it? The contrasted trapezoids like folded-paper art? In one respect, though, I-Pace is a bit of a fashion victim. The exaggerated wheel arches accommodate optional, and audacious, 22-inchers, which is what our test car was wearing. They glam magnificently; but over rough road these biggie wheels trembled hard, even with air springs and adaptive suspension. It's just a bit much unsprung weight.</p>
<p>Still, Jag isn't letting perfect be the enemy of the good.</p>

There was something sensual about it that connected with him. I never had that feeling until I got my first computer, a little 1985 Kaypro. My first week with it, I wrote five stories that were published. Now I love the iMac because I hate clutter. There's nothing on my desk except for it, an Amazon Echo and four drinking birds.</p>
<p>I always have a deck of cards on me. Tally-Ho No. 9, circle back. Always red. They feel the best in my hands. They're $6 a deck. I love them.</p>
<p>The constant hum of airplane engines used to drive me crazy. But my Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless II headphones have changed travel for me completely. They make a flight totally peaceful. I often don't listen to anything.</p>
<p>At home, I play a bright pink Quintus Stringed Instruments carbon fiber double bass. It has a really nice sound that's different from my wooden bass. It feels good to hold -- modern and not delicate. That bright pink makes it look foolish, yet it's very tough and sounds wonderful.</p>
<p>I have large vinyl collection and a Bang &amp; Olufsen Beogram 4002 turntable from the '70s -- a really, really nice one. I don't listen to vinyl often. I also don't believe it sounds better. I think that's a lot of bad science. But I'm old enough that I like seeing a record turning on a turntable. Plus, you get to hold the album and read it again.</p>
<p>I'd never had a car in my life that cost more than $30,000. I had my little Nissan Leaf for a long time, then finally my wife said: "Listen, stupid, just buy a Tesla." So I got the 2018 Tesla Model X and I am very, very fond of it. I never know where I am, so the navigation is wonderful. I love the way the stereo sounds. I love how quiet it is. I'm told it goes fast, but there's a setting called Chill that stops it from going fast. I keep it on that one.</p>
