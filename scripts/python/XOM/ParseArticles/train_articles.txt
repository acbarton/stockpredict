region a spokesman for iraqi deputy prime minister for energy hussein alshahristani said monday the move comes as iraqs central government struggles to assert its authority over energy deals struck within its borders amid a continued lack of legislation for the sector the iraqi government considers as invalid any deals signed with the kurdistan regional government or krg which in turn states that all and any deals it has signed comply with the countrys new constitution the iraqi government has decided that exxon wont be allowed to participate in the next oil and gasbidding round spokesman faisal abdullah told the wall street journal iraq is planning to auction 12 promising exploration blocks seven of which are believed to contain natural gas and five thought to contain crude the new bid round scheduled for may is expected to add some 10 billion barrels of crude oil and some 29 trillion cubic feet of gas to iraqs reserves however it has already been delayed twice amid arguments on whether the contracts offered should be of the productionsharing type wanted by the explorers or the fixedfee service contracts wanted by the government for the next licensing auction baghdad has refused to offer industrystandard productionsharing contracts where the oil company owns a portion of the oil in the ground and can profit from its sale it is instead insisting on service contracts that pay companies a fixed fee for the amount of oil they produce the fixedfee service contracts have worked for the redevelopment of existing oil fields in iraqalbeit with very slim margins for the companies involvedbut are unappealing for many companies facing the gamble of oil exploration said kbc energy economics analyst samuel ciszuk you dont know what youre going to find said mr ciszuk you

barrels we are still waiting for exxon to answer our letters in which we warned that it has to choose between contracts in kurdistan and those in southern iraq the spokesman said adding that depending

with senior exxon executives during a visit to the us and said afterward that the irving texas company had promised to reconsider its dealings with the krg the krg has signed nearly 50 oil and gas

exxon to spend at record level in coming years houstonexxon mobil corp said friday it plans spend a record 37 billion annually in capital projects for the foreseeable future becoming the latest oil giant to unveil an eyepopping capital budget aimed at boosting production and reserves the corporation anticipates an investment profile of about 37 billion per year for the next several years exxon said in an annual report filed with the securities and exchange commission the corporations financial strength enables it to make large longterm capital expenditures the figure is slightly higher than the record 368 billion the texasbased oil major invested in 2011 and a jump from the 322 billion it spent in 2010 the announcement marks the rebirth of a trend towards bigger spending by the oil majors that was interrupted by the global financial crisis which caused oil prices to tumble in 2008 a recovery in crude prices has led the big oil companies to shrug off the uncertainty and keep boosting spending as they seek to fund the projects that will drive production growth and replenish reserves for decades but part of the increased spending comes from higher costs for equipment materials and labor these projects are getting increasingly expensive as companies push technological boundaries to tap reserves in hardtoreach places such as deep water and the arctic rival chevron corp said in december it plans to spend 327 billion in capital projects this year 12 more than in 2011 while conocophillips said its 2012 budget of 148 billion will be 11 higher than in 2011 exxon mobil is the worlds largest publicly traded oil company write to isabel ordonez at  isabelordonezdowjonescom

that means the irving texas oil giant cant report income for that production until later quarters but what i found more troubling this quarter was that their production mix ended up a bit more gassy than i expected mr weiss said with nearly 51 of production coming from natural gas exxons us naturalgas production which has been watched closely because of the companys past insistence if didnt need to ease up on output as prices declined slipped 18 from the fourth quarter and was up less than 1 from a year earlier the company said it was continuing to shift its focus from dry naturalgas production to fields that produced oil and socalled wet gas a mix of natural gas and liquid fuels such as ethane propane and butane that fetch higher prices than dry gas exxons onshore us rig count is also dropping from an average of 72 rigs last year to 64 rigs this week said david rosenthal vice president of investor relations exxons financial strength including some 191 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter means it doesnt feel pressured to slash us gas production said mr rosenthal but during thursdays call with analysts he gave greater emphasis to future production from oil and other nondrygas projects than in past earnings calls if you look at the projects we have scheduled to come on line between now and 2016 80 of them will be liquids production mr rosenthal said the change in drilling focus follows similar moves by other energy producers that have seen cash flows and earnings hit by depressed naturalgas prices which have been trading at their lowest point in a decade at around 2 per million british thermal units the average price at which exxon sold its naturalgas production in the first quarter was 274 per thousand cubic feet down 20 from the same period a year earlier the companys realized price for crude oil was 10568 a barrel 3 higher than a year earlier despite the different quarterly results exxon and shell both said thursday they are considering new us projects that would take advantage of the 10 year low in naturalgas prices mr rosenthal said the company is studying and assessing the opportunities including exporting us natural gas as a liquid and expanding its us chemical plants that use natural gas as a raw material the company is a partner in the recently opened golden pass liquefiednaturalgas import terminal near port arthur texas which could be expanded to include export capacity according to analysts shell chief financial officer simon henry said on a conference call thursday his company is looking at sites in texas and louisiana for a possible naturalgastoliquids plant that would turn natural gas into a fuel like diesel the wall street journal reported on the project plans earlier this month meanwhile shell raised

exxon losing our shirts on natural gas new yorkeven energy titan exxon mobil corp is showing signs of strain from low naturalgas prices on wednesday exxon chief executive rex tillerson broke from the previous company line that it wasnt being hurt by natural gas prices admitting that the irving texasbased firm is among those hurting from the price slump we are all losing our shirts today mr tillerson said in a talk before the council on foreign relations in new york were making no money its all in the red his comments mark a departure from remarks made earlier this year on how lower naturalgas prices hadnt yet hurt the company because of its operational efficiency and low production costs the comments from exxons chief come amid a massive us gas supply glut that has kept prices depressed and helped to reduce energy costs for many consumers and businesses in recent months demand for natural gas from utilities has surged as firms turn to gas instead of more expensive coal to supply electricity just as mr tillerson was speaking however naturalgas prices rallied to a 5 12month high with the july contract settling at 2774 per million british thermal units the fifth straight day of gains exxons 26 billion acquisition of xto energy in 2010 made the company the largest producer of natural gas in the us among us integrated oil companies it is the one that has bet the most on the value of unconventional naturalgas production mr tillerson said last month during exxons shareholders meeting that he had no regrets on the timing of the xto purchase which occurred just before the most recent slump in us gas prices at the companys annual analysts meeting in march exxon said production costs varied greatly from project to project but it wasnt losing money on its naturalgas production but the executive acknowledged wednesday that exxon and most of the industry had grossly underestimated the speed of the us naturalgas boom as the technology to unlock gas trapped in shalerock formations known as hydraulic fracturing advanced faster than expected it shows even exxon can feel the pain from low naturalgas prices said fadel gheit an analyst with oppenheimer in april the company said the average price at which it sold its naturalgas production in the first quarter was 274 per million british thermal units down 20 from the same period a year earlier that price reflects a combination of spot prices and longterm contracted sales but analysts expect that figure to drop market prices have averaged about 220 per million british thermal units in the second quarter down from 270 in the first quarter said guy baber an analyst with simmons co international even during the worst days of 2011 prices averaged more than 350 the message from tillerson is candid and maybe a bit different than in the past but i think this is largely because naturalgas prices are so much weaker now than they have been mr baber said that doesnt mean exxon will necessarily stop drilling for natural gas however the company has started to shift its drilling toward sites with greater potential for oil and naturalgas liquids but it has said repeatedly it believes natural gas will grow significantly in the coming decades the company is designing drilling programs on most of its us gas fields to better assess the longterm prospects of the assets not capture shortterm production and revenue gains with firstquarter earnings of 945 billion and cash reserves of 191 billion exxon has the balance sheet and financial strength to be patient and keep drilling gas wells unlike many smaller oil companies mr baber said in his talk mr tillerson said energy companies wont be able to continue drilling unless prices rise more recently exxon has been studying the possibility of exporting natural gas from the us gulf coast and from canada as shale drilling has unlocked naturalgas reserves to allow exports exxon is following the trend of smaller companies such as cheniere energy inc that have already pursued the necessary permits to export gas from the us on wednesday he said there are enough us oil and gas reserves to provide the domestic economy with fuel through the rest of the century if public policy encourages the industry to say the us is energy poor is simply not accurate mr tillerson said he added us energy security is a matter of policy choices and could be achieved within the visible future north america has become an important area for the development of new energy resources in recent years with surging production in both canada and the us mr tillerson said he was hopeful that reforms in mexico would make possible further collaboration between exxon and mexicos stateowned oil company petroleos mexicanos or pemex write to jerry a dicolo at  and tom fowler at

who really gets rich off high gas prices exxon made seven cents per gallon in 2011 federal state and local governments siphoned off 50 cents in taxes with the average price of gas in america hovering around 350 per gallon for regular unleaded it costs more than 50 to fill a typical cars 15gallon tank this summer why does gas cost so much you may blame high gas prices on rich oil company executives or greedy gas station owners the truth is that governments rake in a larger profit at the pump than anyoneand with gas taxes on the rise in many parts of the country theres no relief in sight the price of a gallon of gas is based on the combination of four costs that of crude oil of refining gas of distribution and marketing and of taxes crude oil costs make up about 76 of the cost of gasoline according to us energy information administration eia thus 266 of a 350 gallon of gasoline is set before the oil is even refined global markets reacting to supply and demand determine the cost of crude oil just like any commodity from gold to corn a shortage in supply or an increase in demand leads to a rise in prices refining oil is the next step in the processand the next expense for drivers gasoline is extracted from crude oil and additives including lubricants and detergents to reduce engine deposits are added as of january 2012 the eia found that refining was responsible for 6 of the cost of gasoline distribution and marketingthe part of the process most apparent to consumersconstitutes another 6 of gas prices that portion of the cost includes the shipping and transportation of the gasoline a markup to cover retailers expenses and any advertising created to appeal to customers the remaining 12or almost 50 cents per gallon todaygoes directly to federal state and local governments in an array of sales and excise taxes the federal gas tax is 184 cents on every gallon of gasoline sold in america state gastax rates vary from a low of eight cents per gallon in alaska to a jarring 49 cents per gallon in new york other states where its steep to fill up include california and connecticuteach with 486centpergallon gas taxesand hawaii at 471 cents per gallon some local governments have gotten in on the act too in california local sales and excise taxes on gasoline average 31 according to the los angeles times that works out to about 12 cents in local taxes for each gallon of gas based on the states current average of 380 per gallon skokie ill a suburb north of chicago levies a gas tax of three cents per gallon youll pay an extra nickel per gallon at gas stations in eugene ore and the next time youre gambling in las vegas youll need plenty of cash left over to cover clark countys 10 cent local tax on a gallon of gas in florida brevard county home to the kennedy space center expects to siphon more than 15 million from motorists this year according to the newspaper florida today put this all together and government makes far more from gas sales than all of the oil companies put together exxon for example made only seven cents per gallon of gasoline in 2011 thats a drop in the bucket compared to the nearly 50 cents per gallon that federal state and local governments rake in on an average gallon of gas pumped in the us most people have to drivewhether to work to the grocery store to pick up kids from school or for dozens of other reasons for some families struggling to make ends meet paying 50 cents per gallon in taxes may be the difference between driving to work and putting dinner on the table so the next time you begin to blame oil companies speculators or service stations for high gas prices remember that no one get richer off of gasoline than government mr johnson is a senior fellow at the taxpayers protection alliance

exxon nears sale of south iraq stake exxon mobil corp is in talks to sell its stake in a contract to develop a multibilliondollar oil project in southern iraq while gearing up to start a controversial drilling effort in the kurdistan region people familiar with the matter said on thursday the us energy giants move to exit southern iraq and push forward with its plans in kurdistan in northern iraq suggests the central governments efforts to keep it operating solely in southern iraq are likely to fail this comes as talks between the kurdistan regional government or krg and the federal government in baghdad aimed at resolving differences over oil rights appear to have stalled again after a brief period of progress exxon has informed top iraqi government officials that it is intending to leave a person familiar with the iraqi oil ministry said exxon mobil is in talks with international oil companies about selling its 60 stake in a service agreement to develop the massive west qurna1 oil field in southern iraq one person familiar with the iraqi oil ministryand another person familiar with exxon mobils operations in kurdistan said on thursday exxons 2010 deal with the iraqi central government to improve production in the west qurna1 field was never expected to be lucrative under the best of circumstances the person said the government had agreed to pay exxon mobil and its partners 190 for each additional barrel of oil they pumped after refurbishing the already producing field the fees would barely be enough to cover the companies costs other deals in southern iraq between baghdad and foreign oil companies had similar terms anglodutch oilandgas company royal dutch shell plc has a 15 stake in the west qurna1 development contract while the remaining 25 is owned by the iraqi state oil company shell declined to comment when asked whether it is interested to buy exxon mobils stake in west qurna1 field meanwhile exxon mobil s planning to start exploratory drilling in kurdistan as soon as early 2013 people with knowledge of exxon mobil and the krg said after delaying such plans for months in order to resolve a dispute with baghdad over deals signed with the krg exxon mobil declined to comment about the talks on exiting southern iraq and plans to begin drilling in kurdistan the us company has already ordered the purchase of oilwell casing heads and is negotiating a contract with an oilservices firm to start drilling in kurdistan said another person familiar with exxon mobils operations in the region they have opened an office in erbil the krg capital he said we know they have been active an executive at a western oil company in kurdistan said about exxon mobil two of the people familiar with the situation said exxon mobil would start drilling operations near mosul in one of the disputed areas that have inflamed tensions between baghdad and erbil in november last year exxon mobil provoked protest from baghdad when it became the first major international oil company to sign petroleum contracts with the krg despite baghdads threats to expel it from a contract in southern iraq exxon mobil signed a deal to develop six blocks with the krg which is locked in a feud with the arabdominated central government over land and oil rights three of the blocks are in areas disputed by erbil and baghdad earlier this year us oil giant chevron corp frances total sa and the oilproducing arm of russias oao gazprom followed exxon mobils lead by striking their own deals in kurdistan the iraqi central government has excluded companies that signed deals with the krg from participating in auctions for future oilexploration rights in southern iraq the central governments reaction suggests kurdish oil developments still face huge political hurdles leaders in baghdad and erbil disagree on the appropriate distribution of power between the regional and central governments the kurds have signed at least 30 oil deals despite the central governments objections and the oil ministry in baghdad has considered those contracts null and void this week a highlevel committee failed to convene a planned meeting aimed at resolving the oil dispute between baghdad and erbil casting doubt on recent progress with the dispute iraqs federal oil minister abdul kareem luaiby and kurdish oil minister ashti hawrami both members of the committee met in baghdad three weeks ago to discuss a draft hydrocarbon law that would regulate the oil industry and to try to agree on a version that would be acceptable to both sides the countrys parliament hasnt been able to advance toward enacting the legislation for years as baghdad and erbil have been at loggerheads over oil rights last month the central government decided to pay international oil companies working in kurdistan some 1 trillion iraqi dinars 850 million and said the krg should increase exports to 200000 barrels a day from this month until the end of the year via iraqs federally controlled pipelines but that settled only part of the dispute between them so far there is no agreement said firhad alatroshi a kurdish parliamentarian and a member of the highlevel committee set up to try to reach an agreement on the draft oil law the hydrocarbon law will be important in settling a longstanding dispute between baghdad and the regional government in kurdistan baghdad doesnt recognize scores of deals signed by the kurds with foreign companies the central government wants to review these deals and bring them in line with oil laws valid in baghdad kurds are opposing a new version of the law that assigns powers of the highest hydrocarbon authority the federal oil and gas council to the federal prime minister while the kurds want powers to rest with a collective authority whose members are to be nominated by the parliament baghdad and the kurds are most divided over the extent of decentralization and federalism in the oil sector we are opposing a provision of the current draft law that forbids regions within iraq from having the right to negotiate and sign contracts said mr alatroshi some experts on the region say that both sides need to make some concessions to reach agreement on the draft law while others say the kurds wouldnt accept baghdad controlling the regions oil resources and changing deals already signed with international oil companies compromise on the oil and gas issue has always been important because of a fundamental contradiction between baghdads and erbils vision of power and sovereignty in iraq said raad alkadiri director for country strategies and partner at pfc energy the washington dcbased strategicadvisory firm i do not expect the kurds to be willing to compromise away their own oil law which gives them exclusive right to govern their own resources and the control over their natural resources as this is the economic fundament for their retention of their farreaching autonomy over the long term said samuel ciszuk an analyst at ukbased consultancy kbc energy economics the kurds also disagree with the current draft of the iraq hydrocarbon law because it gives the federal oil ministry exclusive powers that overwhelm those of the proposed federal oil and gas council mr alatroshi said write to hassan hafidh at

the new haven for investors shortterm bonds of exxon and j treasurys have a new rival for safehaven status us companies bonds of exxon mobil and johnson johnson are trading with yields below those of comparable treasurys a sign that investors perceive them as a safer bet it is a rare phenomenon that some market observers said could be the beginning of a new era for debt markets it could ultimately mean some companies will borrow at lower rates than the us government for now just a handful of relatively shortterm bonds yield less than comparable treasury bonds but some market observers said some fundamental changes in the financial health of us companies relative to the government including the fact that some corporations are more highly rated than uncle sam suggest it could become a longerlasting trend if it grows to be more like dozens of issues then it stops becoming an anomaly and it becomes a big deal said james bianco founder of bianco research in chicago mr bianco recalled a few similar instances in the past 30 years but none lasted long since the turn of the 20th century treasurys have formed the benchmark for fixedrate us company debt companies and investors measure corporate borrowing rates relative to what the government pays but several forces are combining to upend that market convention money is pouring into highly rated us corporate bonds at an even faster pace than treasury debt according to fundtracker lipper as buyers clamor for investments perceived as safe that typically also yield a bit more than treasurys a shrinking supply of toprated debt is also driving investors toward the highestrated us companies that demand has driven up bond prices and pushed down yields the soaring demand has enabled companies of all sizes to raise 12 trillion from issuing debt this year already the busiest year on record according to data provider dealogic us corporations now sitting on 173 trillion of cash and borrowing at the lowest rates in history are arguably in the best shape ever should the economy continue to pick up steam us companies will become even healthier some argue by contrast the treasury is burdened with more debt than ever and government deficits are likely to keep increasing for the foreseeable future the prospect of further upheaval as congress battles whether to extend a raft of tax cuts and clip spending is adding to the uncertainty some investors worry that the country could face a second creditrating downgrade following standard poors cut below triplea last year every day the debt and credit profile of the us gets worse yet you have corporate america that is lean and mean said jason graybill senior managing director at carret who oversees a 12 billion bond portfolio and sold treasurys 18 months ago to pile into more corporate debt its only a matter of time before companies offer new debt below treasury yields he said still some observers argue that yields on corporate bonds could soon rise they said the bonds of exxon and johnson johnson are shortterm bonds that are inherently volatile and others said us government debt is still widely seen as the safest debt available the market is larger and much more active making it more attractive than corporate debt to some investors the treasury has an unlimited printing press and there will always be demand said kam poon portfolio manager of shortterm fixedincome strategies at aberdeen asset management in philadelphia mr poon who oversees 11 billion of bonds has sold corporate bonds in which the yields have been close to treasurys as well as

worlds largest publicly traded oil company by market capitalization is counting on kearl and 20 other new projects to jumpstart its slumping oil and gas output which plummeted to threeyear lows in its most recent quarter exxon shares have gained 39 so far this year though they are little changed from where they stood five years ago the shares closed at 8810 on wednesday on the new york stock exchange some analysts are skeptical the spate of projects  from indonesia and papua new guinea to the deep waters off west africa  will begin by 2014 as exxon predicts and deliver the infusion of oil and gas it anticipates exxon estimates the projects could increase its daily oil production by up to 880000 barrels or about 22 of its current daily output delays are the rule not the exception in this industry said fadel gheit an analyst with oppenheimer analysts with ubs expect exxons 2012 production to be down 57 for the year compared with an expected 29 drop for chevron corp a 27 decline for bp plc and a 22 increase for royal dutchshell increasing oil output has become daunting for energy companies such as exxon because big oil fields in easy to reach locations have gotten scarce and governmentcontrolled oil companies from countries such as russia and china have become more aggressive spending freely to outbid western firms for the rights to the best projects there are other obstacles to production growth including depletion of existing oil fields which generally lose 5 to 7 of their output per year according to analysts lysle brinker director of energyequity research for ihscera said exxon has a good record for completing major projects close to budget and schedule theyd be the first to admit it doesnt always go smoothly but exxon has a better reputation than most for hitting its deadlines mr brinker said exxon declined to discuss the startup risks associated with specific projects in discussions with analysts and investors its executives have stressed they arent looking to increase production overnight or at the expense of profitability but bet on big projects that will provide significant profits for the long haul exxons annual spending on exploration and production projects has increased sharply it now plans to spend around 37 billion per year through 2016 up from less than 20 billion in 2009 off the coast of angola exxon is expecting additional

guinea meanwhile a liquefiednaturalgas project is expected to export up to 940000 cubic feet of gas  equivalent to 166000 barrels of oil  to china and other asian markets by 2014 but the venture is proving more costly than anticipated exxon increased the price tag on the project by 21 to 19 billion this month citing changes in foreignexchange rates and delays from work stoppages the brunt of its projected production growth through 2014 37 comes from canadian oilsands projects such as kearl which has been in the works since 2009 but the oilsands projects are in remote locations that require many workers and billions of dollars in capital they are also hamstrung in reaching customers outside of canada due to limited pipeline capacity the 700000barrelperday keystone xl pipeline which will carry canadian crude to gulf coast refiners is seen as one way around those limitations but the project has faced stiff opposition even if all of the new projects come to pass they wouldnt make up for exxons possible exit from a burgeoning project in southern iraq that was expected to produce up to 16 million barrels a day for the company by 2016 despite the companys challenges some analysts are

exxon delay worsened oil spill us probe finds exxon mobil corp delayed in entirely shutting down a ruptured pipeline in a montana river in 2011 allowing an extra 1000 barrels of crude oil to spill into the yellowstone river federal investigators said in a report released wednesday the department of transportation investigation found that scouring or floodinduced erosion along the riverbed exposed exxons silvertip pipeline beneath the river causing it to break in july 2011 recognizing a drop in pressure on the pipeline an exxon controller closed some valves within 10 minutes of the break investigators said but the worker and supervisors then discussed potential causes of the pressure drop for 46 minutes before closing other valves investigators found increasing the size of the spill by about twothirds to more than 1500 barrels had exxons emergency shutdown procedures included the requirement that these valves were to be closed immediately after an abnormal event the crude oil release volume would have been much less the report said the accident report details the cause of the spill but does not specify fault or weigh whether exxon violated rules the dot said it is reviewing the report to determine if exxon will be sanctioned exxon declined to comment because the company said it is still reviewing the report those four pipes were installed at the federal minimum depth of four to five feet beneath the riverbed river experts say that requirement is lacking and in 2011 the us geological survey found scouring on the missouri river basin which includes the yellowstone dug as deep as 41 feet into the riverbed congress last year ordered the dot to review pipeline accidents at river crossings that report which was also released on wednesday found that since 1991 scouring has helped cause at least 16 pipeline breaks in the us spilling a combined 57680 barrels of hazardous liquids the accidents account for 05 of significant hazardousliquid incidents in the us over the period exxon has since reburied some pipeline river crossings much deeper in montana state officials said daniel gilbert contributed to this article amplifications exxon mobil didnt install all four pipelines in the area of the yellowstone river hit by a rupture and oil spill in 2011 an earlier version of this article incorrectly said that exxon had installed all four pipelines

the big challenge beneath exxon mobils big buybacks financial analysis and commentary well folks hes just flown in from dallas and boy are his jokes tired kicking off exxon mobils annual analyst day in new york on wednesday ceo rex tillerson cracked his usual joke about how nice it is to be in the big apple  to visit exxon moved its headquarters from manhattan to texas back in the 1980s so familiar is this backhanded compliment from the texan that deutsche bank analyst paul sankey kicked off his premeeting report predicting it would make an appearance then given exxon usually holds its meeting in march there was a standard quip about the cold although mr tillerson added that there was nothing wrong with such weather this was possibly a sly reference to how it helps prop up naturalgas prices for exxon that is black comedy given its 2010 purchase of shalegas pioneer xto energy hasnt been a crowd pleaser then again making tasteful jokes about gas is never easy subscribe to

majors stock repurchases have totaled 207 billionbigger than the market capitalization of all but 11 members of the s p 500 that is impressive but also a sign of headaches for big oil exxons buybacks reflect an embarrassment of riches free cash flow after capital expenditure has averaged 26 billion a year over the past decade according to s p capital iq despite 2012s 21 increase exxon pays a relatively low dividend its stock yields just 26 against chevrons 3 and royal dutch shells 53 but its buybacks21 billion last yeardwarf those of its rivals buybacks provide a currency for acquisitions and support exxons valuation in two ways first they create demand for the stock second by reducing the share count they ensure each remaining share owns a bigger slice of exxons assets yet it is the latter point where concerns begin exxons impressive pershare performance also serves to emphasize underlying challenges for example production per share increased 48 between 2003 and 2012 but in absolute terms it rose less than 1 the strain was evident at exxons analyst day last week it reset its overall productiongrowth guidance to 2 to 3 a year that is good but it comes off a lower base given that output fell 57 in 2012 and the guidance excludes the impact of any future divestments given the companys recent big increase in capital expenditure exxon is funding its buyback program partly through assets sales but these reduce production putting those growth targets at risk exxon has struggled to square this circle in the past deutsche bank analyst paul sankey says that the firm last hit its annual production target in 2006 looking ahead it is hard to see the current runrate of buybacks and growth targets both holding up and money spent buying ones own stock isnt invested in other producing assets companies can argue that their stock is undervalued so buying it represents a good bet but that is harder to say in exxons case its stock already trades at a big premium to its peers and its buybacks have been procyclical peaking in intensity in 2008 just as oil prices hit an alltime high this has implications for the return on that investment looking at rolling threeyear returnsexcluding dividendsexxon made big gains on stock bought before 2006 as the shares began catching up with rising oil prices but implied returns on stock repurchased around the oilprice peak are very low moreover the implied gain to date on stock bought since the xto energy deal was announcedsince which exxons shares have struggledis just 14 buybacks symbolize exxons many strengths but they also emphasize its great challenge finding suitably sized investments offering high rates of return this is hampered in places such as iraq by resource nationalism it is hampered in north america by an unforeseen shale revolution and the highly priced xto deal if exxon could have a doover it might have redirected more of that cash spent on buybacks toward capital expenditure and acquisitions instead it seems exxon didnt really buy into the notion of rising energy prices today spending huge amounts it is of necessity a believer but it is paying the price for its earlier lack of faith write

the big challenge beneath exxon mobils big buybacks financial analysis and commentary how does exxon mobil grow by shrinking exxon tends to go big or go home and its stock buybacks are no exception over the past decade the oil majors stock repurchases have totaled 207 billion  bigger than the market capitalization of all but 11 members of the s p 500 that is impressive but also a sign of headaches for big oil exxons buybacks reflect an embarrassment of riches free cash flow after capital expenditure has averaged 26 billion a year over the past decade according to s p capital iq despite 2012s 21 increase exxon pays a relatively low dividend its stock yields just 26 against chevrons 3 and royal dutch shells 53 but its buybacks  21 billion last year  dwarf those of its rivals buybacks provide a currency for acquisitions and support exxons valuation in two ways first they create demand for the stock second by reducing the share count they ensure each remaining share owns a bigger slice of exxons assets yet it is the latter point where concerns begin exxons impressive pershare performance also serves to emphasize underlying challenges for example production per share increased 48 between 2003 and 2012 but in absolute terms it rose less than 1 the strain was evident at exxons analyst day last week it reset its overall productiongrowth guidance to 2 to 3 a year that is good but it comes off a lower base given that output fell 57 in 2012 and the guidance excludes the impact of any future divestments given the companys recent big increase in capital expenditure exxon is funding its buyback program partly through assets sales but these reduce production putting those growth targets at risk exxon has struggled to square this circle in the past deutsche bank analyst paul sankey says that the firm last hit its annual production target in 2006 looking ahead it is hard to see the current runrate of buybacks and growth targets both holding up and money spent buying ones own stock isnt invested in other producing assets companies can argue that their stock is undervalued so buying it represents a good bet but that is harder to say in exxons case its stock already trades at a big premium to its peers and its buybacks have been procyclical peaking in intensity in 2008 just as oil prices hit an alltime high this has implications for the return on that investment looking at rolling threeyear returns  excluding dividends  exxon made big gains on stock bought before 2006 as the shares began catching up with rising oil prices but implied returns on stock repurchased around the oilprice peak are very low moreover the implied gain to date on stock bought since the xto energy deal was announced  since which exxons shares have struggled  is just 14 buybacks symbolize exxons many strengths but they also emphasize its great challenge finding suitably sized investments offering high rates of return this is hampered in places such as iraq by resource nationalism it is hampered in north america by an unforeseen shale revolution and the highly priced xto deal if exxon could have a doover it might have redirected more of that cash spent on buybacks toward capital expenditure and acquisitions instead it seems exxon didnt really buy into the notion of rising energy prices today spending huge amounts it is of necessity a believer but it is paying the price for its earlier lack of faith subscribe to wsj enlarge this image

exxon cleans up after arkansas oil spill exxon mobil corp is working to clean up thousands of barrels of oil that spilled from its pipeline into an arkansas residential neighborhood friday afternoon the us environmental protection agency is categorizing the incident as a major spill the company said which means that more than 250 barrels of oil have been released exxon said a few thousand barrels of oil have been observed in the area but the company is staging a response worthy of a spill of more than 10000 barrels to be conservative mayflower the site of the spill is in faulkner county about 25 miles outside of little rock ark the city evacuated 22 homes friday as oil flowed into yards and through the streets exxon said saturday it had about 100 workers in the area and had deployed 2000 feet of containment boom and had 15 vacuum trucks at work cleaning up the oil saturday afternoon the company said it has recovered 4500 barrels of oil and water on saturday faulkner county judge allen dodson said the us epa has estimated that as much as 2000 barrels have been released into the neighborhood but so far responders have been able to stop that oil from flowing into lake conway a nearby 6700acre freshwater lake mr dodson said it looks like the cleanup effort might take several weeks on saturday crews were working to keep the oil contained even as rain pelted the earthen dams put in place to hold the oil back he said were dealing with added water flow from the rain mr dodson said if the early estimates prove to be correct the spill could be larger than a 2011 pipeline leak into the yellowstone river in montana on monday us pipeline regulators proposed a 17 million fine against exxon for allegedly not doing enough to prevent that leak of about 1500 barrels of crude into the river after the pipeline ruptured during severe flooding the regulators also proposed that exxon employees be required to put in place a training program to teach employees how to react to emergencies at the companys pipelines exxon said it was disappointed in the regulators findings and that it has applied lessons learned from the montana spill to its remotecontrolvalve procedures and operator training in a filing with the national response center friday exxon reported that the amount of oil released was unknown but told regulators that the incident may be a significant material release exxon said friday evening that the pipeline which carries oil from a hub in patoka ill to the texas gulf coast was shut down the pipeline delivers oil to the sunoco logistics terminal in nederland texas where it is then shipped to various houston area refiners according to the exxon pipeline cos website write to alison sider at 
exxon plans worlds biggest floating lng plant sydneyexxon mobil corp laid out plans for a development using the worlds biggest floating naturalgasprocessing plant in a technically challenging move that underscores its bullish view on asian demand for the fuel exxon and partner bhp billiton ltd want to anchor a vessel extending 495 meters 541 yards at sea to tap into the remote scarborough naturalgas field offshore western australia they are seeking government approval for the multibilliondollar project and targeting first production as early as 2020 floating liquefiednaturalgas technology known as flng is untried but has captured the attention of some of the worlds biggest energy companies seeking to access gas fields that are too small or remote to develop using pipelines and onshore facilities royal dutch shell plc is a leading proponent of flng vessels which it plans to deploy in australia and possibly elsewhere the relative calm of the waters off australias northeastern coastline make the country a strong candidate to accommodate the worlds first flng vessels its stable political environment and proximity to asian markets are also drawcards according to the international energy agency chinas naturalgas demand alone will more than quadruple to 545 billion cubic meters 19247 trillion cubic feet between 2011 and 2035 however companies like exxon need to ensure their vessels can withstand stormy seas one main concern is that the forces generated by liquefied gas sloshing in partially filled containers can damage the storage system that issue is being addressed with containers designed to minimize sloshing and with elaborate anchoring systems that limit the movement of vessels in the water exxons proposed facility would produce between six million and seven million metric tons of liquefied natural gas or lng a year for several decades lng is natural gas chilled to a liquid so that it can be shipped by tanker the scarborough resource was discovered in 1979 and is estimated to hold up to 10 trillion cubic feet of gas equal to more than a third of the uss annual gas consumption early design work would begin next year ahead of a final investment decision in 201415 exxon said in a filing to the australian governments environment department a melbournebased spokeswoman for exxon said flng has the capacity to reduce our capital costs by removing the need for infrastructure and has a smaller environmental footprint with close to a dozen naturalgas export terminals planned for its coastline australia is poised to leapfrog qatar as the worlds top exporter of lng by the end of the decade the industry however is facing cost headwinds driven by a strong local currency and a shortage of skilled labor underscoring these challenges chevron corp and jointventure partners including exxon and shell said in december the cost of building their giant gorgon lng project on the western australian coast had expanded by a fifth to 52 billion australian dollars us544 billion the budget overruns come as australia is likely to face rising competition from emerging gasexport industries in north america and africa which could make it tougher to secure customers flng is often touted by company executives as a means of mitigating cost pressures because much of the construction process occurs offshore in countries with cheaper sources of labor companies also dont have to pay for acquiring and clearing land for some of the more economically challenged gas resources out there floating lng is going to take on a much higher profile said andrew williams a melbournebased energy analyst at rbc capital markets in 2011 shell committed to use a flng vessel to process natural gas from its prelude field in the browse basin offshore northwestern australia the vessel is due to begin producing 36 million tons of lng each year from 2017 shell estimated that its project would cost between us3 billion and us35 billion for every one million tons of production capacity or between us108 billion and us126 billion in its filing tuesday exxon didnt estimate a cost for its scarborough development 
arkansas water system to ask exxon to move its pipeline arkansas officials plan to ask exxon mobil corp xom to move a portion of its pegasus pipeline to ensure safe drinking water after thousands of barrels of oil last week spilled from the pipeline into a smalltown neighborhood the pipeline runs for 13 miles through the lake maumelle watershed an 88000acre area that drains into the main source of drinking water for 400000 people in central arkansas watershed protection manager john tynan who works for the areas water authority central arkansas water said in an interview that the water system has always been aware of the pipeline the oil conduit has been there longer than lake maumelle and was rerouted when the lake was built in the 1950s so as not to run directly under the water the water system has worked closely with exxon to check for potential problems with the pipeline and to prepare for the risk of a spill but he said the only way to completely eliminate the risk would be to move the pipeline further away obviously there will always be some risk to the watershed as long as the pipeline is present there so with recent occurrences this just heightens concerns weve had for some time in an email to pulaski county ark justices of the peace monday mr tynan wrote that the system will submit a formal request to exxon to move the pipeline and is also asking that the company hold off on restarting it until assurances can be provided that the line in the watershed has been deemed safe a spokesman for exxon declined to comment on the proposal exxons pegasus pipeline a 95000barreladay conduit that transports heavy canadian crude from patoka ill to the texas gulf coast has been shut in since friday when the spill occurred in mayflower ark cleanup efforts were still underway tuesday and exxon said it was working on a plan to bring residents back to 22 homes that had been evacuated the arkansas attorney generals office said tuesday that it is opening an investigation into the spill a first step in determining whether the oil giant may be liable for the consequences of the spill under the arkansas water and air pollution act and other laws there are many questions and concerns remaining as to the longterm impacts environmental and otherwise from this spill he wrote tuesday asking the company to retain all its documents and data relevant to the spill and cleanup effort the cause of the spill is still unknown exxon spokeswoman rachael moore said tuesday that the company will cooperate fully with any investigation the company plans to excavate and remove the affected section of pipe to take a closer look in an interview arkansas attorney general dustin mcdaniel declined to speculate on the total cost of the spill but he said the states claims could include damages to groundwater and surface impacts including lost tourism dollars from nearby lake conway and the impact to local businesses drawing a parallel to bps payments to businesses affected by the 2010 deepwater horizon disaster in the gulf of mexico though on a much much smaller scale mr mcdaniel said he had communicated with attorney generals in mississippi and louisiana about their states responses to oil spills its certainly the first time since ive been attorney general that ive had to take this kind of action with this kind of environmental incident he said on a much much smaller scale than what we saw bp have to pay in the gulf if businesses or the economy in addition to our natural resources were damaged by the rupture in the pipeline then obviously its going to be incumbent on the attorney generals office to explore the states options mr mcdaniel said mr mcdaniel said the state attorney generals office and the state insurance department would assist homeowners with their private claims against exxon if needed exxons pipeline had once shipped gulf coast crude north to the chicago area but was little used when the company decided to reverse the flow in 2006 to carry canadian oil the leaking section of pipeline was built in the late 1940s but passed a highpressure test in january 2006 and an internal inspection in july 2010 done by a piece of equipment that measures for metal loss or other anomalies according to exxon mobil officials in 2011 the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration ordered exxon to pay a 26200 fine for letting more than five years pass before inspecting the area where the pipeline crosses under the mississippi river between illinois and missouri hundreds of miles from where the pipeline leaked last week most of the homes in the neighborhood where the oil spilled were built shortly after exxon mobil restarted the pipeline in 2006 many homeowners including joe bradley who bought his home new in 2008 were not aware of the pipeline running nearby mr bradley said he has asked exxon to purchase his house because he does not feel safe living there with his 8yearold daughter they have not hurt my property value they more or less threw it out the window with this spill mr bradley said theres no way could sell that home now nor would i except to exxon tom fowler contributed

big spills from aging oil pipelines seam failures from old outmoded welds are under study after exxon and chevron lines rupture recent pipeline ruptures including one at an exxon mobil corp pipeline that caused a major oil spill in arkansas last month are raising fresh questions about the safety of pipes made decades ago using obsolete welding techniques though the industry stopped making what is known as lowfrequency electricresistance welded pipe by about 1970 it still accounts for more than a quarter of the 182500 miles of liquid fuel pipelines across the us according to federal data for 2011 the latest available the accidents come as federal regulators are examining whether stateoftheart inspection methods are capable of detecting flaws in these old pipe seams a us regulator has commissioned a study of old substandard pipe that could help shape new rules in the exxon rupture and another on a chevron corp pipeline in utah last month that spilled 600 barrels of diesel near the great salt lake segments of the pipes were made about 60 years ago by bending metal sheets to form a tube then heating the edges with a lowfrequency electric current to weld them lengthwise such welds can leave defects in seams that make them vulnerable to corrosion and cracks risks that have been known for decades the chevron pipeline appeared to split along the welded seam according to federal regulators a chevron spokesman said while the investigation continues initial indications are that the release may have been the result of a longitudinal seam failure in the pipeline the exxon pipeline gushed about 5000 barrels of crude into a residential neighborhood through a 22foot incisionlike break it clearly looks like a seamtype failure rick kuprewicz a seattlebased pipelinesafety consultant said after seeing photographs of the exxon rupture exxon spokesman alan jeffers said the company hasnt reached any conclusions on the cause of the pipeline failure and is awaiting a thirdparty review of the ruptured section which was removed on monday if we felt there was a problem we would have done something else but in hindsight clearly there was an issue mr jeffers said of

big spills lurk inside aging pipelines  old welding technique examined after exxon chevron lines rupture crude oil on the culdesac recent pipeline ruptures including one at an exxon mobil corp pipeline that caused a major oil spill in arkansas last month are raising fresh questions about the safety of pipes made decades ago using obsolete welding techniques though the industry stopped making what is known as lowfrequency electricresistance welded pipe by about 1970 it still accounts for more than a quarter of the 182500 miles of liquid fuel pipelines across the us according to federal data for 2011 the latest available the accidents come as federal regulators are examining whether stateoftheart inspection methods are capable of detecting flaws in these old pipe seams a us regulator has commissioned a study of old substandard pipe that could help shape new rules in the exxon rupture and another on a chevron corp pipeline in utah last month that spilled 600 barrels of diesel near the great salt lake segments of the pipes were made about 60 years ago by bending metal sheets to form a tube then heating the edges with a lowfrequency electric current to weld them lengthwise such welds can leave defects in seams that make them vulnerable to corrosion and cracks risks that have been known for decades the chevron pipeline appeared to split along the welded seam according to federal regulators a chevron spokesman said while the investigation continues initial indications are that the release may have been the result of a longitudinal seam failure in the pipeline the exxon pipeline gushed about 5000 barrels of crude into a residential neighborhood through a 22foot incisionlike break it clearly looks like a seamtype failure rick kuprewicz a pipelinesafety consultant said after seeing photographs of the exxon rupture exxon spokesman alan jeffers said the company hasnt reached any conclusions on the cause of the pipeline failure and is awaiting a thirdparty review of the ruptured section which was removed on monday if we felt there was a problem we would have done something else but in hindsight clearly there was an issue mr jeffers

bp seeks its inner exxon the oil giant tries to shed its reputation as a serial capitulator cant we all get along the answer is no for good reason conflict is the noise of a healthy society going about its business lawsuits though sometimes abusive when the legal system dangles perverse incentives are evidence of americans vindicating their rights bp after the gulf spill was beset by a legal and political firestorm the company faced a financial threat that could have led to bankruptcy or dismemberment faustian is not quite the word for the deal bp announced on march 3 2012 with the socalled plaintiffs steering committee it agreed to compensate gulfarea businesses and individuals for economic losses without proof those losses were related to the spill worse whether any losses occurred would be determined by a casual process that virtually invited plaintiffs to game their financial statements the craziest thing wrote one lawyer touting his services to clients is that you can be compensated for losses that are unrelated to the spill unexpectedly but perhaps not surprisingly law firms themselves turned out to be among the biggest claimants in a recent round of payouts totalling 100 million 33 million went to six law firms that claimed they suffered economic losses due to the spill says bp spokesman geoff morrell on monday before a us appeals court bp will argue that the claims procedure it agreed to is being unfairly and perhaps corruptly administered by a courtappointed lawyer and his staff in a different case before the same new orleans judge who upheld the claims process bp is also settling in for a long fight over whether the spill amounted to gross negligence the orneriness represents a change in the companys attitude once bp said it didnt want the deepwater horizon accident to become exxon valdez whose litigation dragged on for 20 years now some inside bp are starting to look at exxon as an inspiration when an exxon tanker ran aground in alaska in 1989 the company did not deny responsibility it pled guilty to four federal crimes paying 125 million in fines it settled a 22 million damages claim by native communities though exxon stipulated that damage occurred when thousands of plaintiffs lined up exxon reasonably concluded that only litigation could determine how much injury occurred and who suffered it plaintiffs also sought huge punitive damages in excess of any actual harm suffered exxon fought them all the way to the supreme court which reduced a 5 billion jury award to 500 million from the getgo bps dilemma was worse than exxons washington could probably have put the foreignowned company out of business if it had wanted to bp quickly accepted responsibility for the deepwater horizon accident in advance of any court proceeding it announced a 20 billion compensation fund but bp which had access to the john grisham library could not have been naive about what would follow from the strategy it adopted bp money has been used by gulf localities for reasons having nothing to do with the spill to repair hurricane damage to marshes to build a convention center to benefit local burghers who suffered no harm alabamas attorney general personally barnstormed his state with the courtappointed claims administrator louisiana lawyer pat juneau together they urged alabamans to get in on a hell of a deal in a grishamlike plot twist one attorney now has been bounced as claims adjudicator amid allegations he received contingency payments from lawyers whose claims he approved another bigwig trial attorney who once hosted president obama for a fundraiser at his home was forced to withdraw from the plaintiffs steering committee amid charges he signed up local vietnamese residents as plaintiffs without their knowledge in mondays hearing bps opponents will argue this is exactly what bp bargained for a quick and dirty solution to buy off local influentials and soften up the tort bar by handing out easy money what the company got instead is a reputation as a serial capitulator now bp is trying to claw back credibility to resist an open raid on its pocketbook in britain the press has had a field day playing on stereotypes of southern justice which may or may not weigh with the appeals court which is expected to issue a decision as early as next week but theres a larger lesson many politicians and activists seem to think businesses should preemptively surrender their own interests in clashes with the public interest but there is no heavenly determined public interest there are only various parties whose claims should never be credited without examination the rule of law is not an inconvenience but a necessity unless we want pillage to become the rule in our society next time a company finds itself in bps positionas difficult as that position wasit might do better to wrap itself in the flag and head straight to court 
exxon report finds outdated welding caused arkansas pipeline rupture lab says seam cracks tied to 1940s welding led to march spill of 5000 barrels of oil an independent report found that a rupture in an exxon mobil corp pipeline that spilled thousands of barrels of oil in mayflower arkansas earlier this year was caused by defects tied to when the pipe was built in the 1940s the company said an independent metallurgical laboratory looked at the section of the pipe that ripped open in march spilling an estimated 5000 barrels of oil into a residential neighborhood in the small town about 25 miles from little rock exxon said thursday it is reviewing the results of that assessment which were provided to the company and the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration on wednesday the texas oil giant said that according to the report hookshaped cracks along the pipes seams were the root cause of the pipes failure not corrosion the cracks are related to an outdated welding process that as the wall street journal reported in april is no longer performed on new pipes but that still affects thousands of miles of pipelines in use across the us the lab also found that the pipelines limited flexibility also contributed to the incident exxon said the report hasnt been made public and phmsa is still reviewing it a spokesman for the agency said the section of the pipe that ruptured is more than 60 years old but passed a highpressure test in 2006 and an internal inspection in 2010 that sought to measure metal loss or other anomalies exxon said aaron stryk a spokesman for exxon said the full results of a more detailed inspection exxon conducted earlier this year arent yet available that inspection called a transverse flux uses a magnetic field to find corrosion along seams it can also detect cracks and other defects though not as reliably as it can detect corrosion according to phmsas website once the results come out the company will review whether it needs to make changes to its pipeline integrity management program mr stryk said but it isnt clear how reliable that test will be in detecting potential problems along pipeline seams said rick kuprewicz a pipelinesafety consultant thats the million dollar question mr kuprewicz said the type of cracks found to have caused the rupture in mayflower are associated with some types of an early welding process called electric resistance welding according to phmsas website that process hasnt been used on new pipelines since about 1970 but about a quarter of the 182500 miles of liquid fuel pipelines across the us were welded that way according to the most recent federal data other pipeline ruptures have been linked to electrically welded pipe over the years including a 2007 break in a liquidpropane pipe near carmichael miss which caused a fire that killed two people in 2011 phmsa commissioned a study of how to detect problems in these pipes and prevent the pipes from failing while in use arkansas and the us government have sued exxon for allegedly violating pollution laws the arkansas attorney general hasnt yet seen the testing results a spokesman for the office said write to alison sider at

corporate news exxon chevron tap less oil and gas happy anniversary big oil the worlds energy supermajors wouldnt mind seeing crude hit 147 a barrel as it did exactly five years ago but their shareholders arent exactly pining for the days of yore that is despite the fact that the companies earn a lot less profit and even pump fewer hydrocarbons today with bp plc exxon mobil corp chevron corp and royal dutch shell plc announcing quarterly results this week it is clear that size and even growth are overrated those four companies made a combined 28 billion in profit during the previous quarter although oil prices today arent far off their level during the spring of 2008 those earnings are 10 billion less than what the companies made five years ago part of the reason is that they havent invested as aggressively and in the case of bp following its legal woes related to the gulf of mexico oil spill have even sold assets today the four companies produce about 136 million barrels of oil equivalent a day among them five years ago their output was about 300000 barrels a day more another reason is that much of the equivalent happens to be natural gas not oil in the huge north american market gas prices have collapsed from their levels of the mid2000s amid a shaledrilling bonanza though net income is lower share buybacks and dividend increases have enriched shareholders an investor owning one share or depositary receipt of each company could expect to reap 1044 in dividends over the next 12 months compared with the 888 paid five years ago more impressive still is that even compared with the time of the peak oil price five years ago the companies are worth more a portfolio containing a share of each is now 11 more valuable that is surprising given the fantastic projections about the energy market some investors made back then there was talk of superspikes and crude hitting 200 a barrel today investors are attracted to oil producers cash flow in a lowyield world each dollar spent on exploration is one less that can be used to shrink the share base or pay dividends though it turns out that sometimes less really is more medium oil may take some getting

shaleboom profits bypass big oil shell exxon came late to the party then made massive investments the term big oil usually conjures up images of colossal rigs operating in high seas or suits cutting deals in a grand game of oil and geopolitics how about giant hamsters this weeks quarterly results from three of the biggest names in oilexxon mobil royal dutch shell and bpprovided dismal confirmation that they are running furiously just to stand still and they are falling down on the wheel big oils big dilemma is that every barrel pumped out of the ground has to be replaced with new reserves unless companies want to shrink to nothing if they want to increase production they need to discover more than one barrel for every one pumped that is a huge task especially for the likes of exxon it produced 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent last year to put that in perspective the global industrys average discovery between 2002 and 2011 was about 65 million barrels of oil equivalent according to wood mackenzie little wonder that exxons 2012 production was only slightly higher than in 2003 and that its proved oil reserves were actually lower exxon like many of the majors only belatedly bought into 100 oil being sustainable in the previous decade and so underinvested in its reserves it is now making up for that in spades capital expenditure is on pace to hit 41 billion this year meanwhile exxons margins per barrel have taken a hit in recent years after the highprice acquisition of shalegas giant xto energy itself an attempt to boost reserves the resulting squeeze on cash flow explains why exxon said thursday it expects to cut its sharebuyback program again in the third quarter having slowed it already in the one just gone little wonder the stock dropped about 2 that is nothing compared to shell though whose stock plunged more than 4 thursday on a truly woeful set of results again the strain of trying to maintain the pace of production and reserves weighed heavily in particular shell appears to have overreached in its big foray into north american shale to build reserves that it had to take a writedown of 21 billion on these assets while oil flirts with 110 a barrel suggests it picked up some decidedly inferior assets in its shale grab the oil major also abandoned its mediumterm production target a big oil riteofpassage repeated so often it has become a clich bp is another victim of the reach for growth russia originally the oil majors supposed ticket to endless reserves came back to bite bp in the second quarter after a long tortuous process bps forays into russia have ended up in part with it owning almost 20 of kremlinbacked giant rosneft that is worth about 16 billion equivalent to around 12 of bps own market capitalization significant exposure with little control weak profits from its rosneft stake due in part to foreignexchange moves helped push down bps secondquarter underlying profit to 20 below the consensus forecast scale is

exxon seeks to sell stake in iraq field to petrochina conocophillips reached a deal to sell an oilsands leasehold in canada to exxon mobil corp for about 720 million continuing the companys efforts to sell assets worth billions of dollars exxons canadian subsidiary will take a 725 stake in the clyden oilsands leasehold which consist of about 226000 acres of undeveloped land near the southern edge of the athabasca oil sands about 275 miles northeast of edmondton alberta the rest of the leasehold being sold will go to exxon affiliate imperial oil ltd conocophillips is in the process of selling noncore assets to focus on those with higher returns such as fastgrowing us shale formations so far the company pegged expected sale proceeds at about 135 billion for 2012 and 2013 if canadian regulators approve the deal the company said it expects to record an aftertax gain of about 450 million likely in the third quarter conocophillips currently holds roughly 11 million net acres of land in the athabasca containing the equivalent of about 16 billion barrels of crude making it one of the biggest players in the region raymond james analyst pavel molchanov said the sale was a relatively small one but brings in cash conocophillips needs to fund its capital program and dividend the company is still weighing further sales in the region our world class oil sands assets have attracted significant interest from buyers around the world and we are currently evaluating a number of offers for these assets a conocophillips spokeswoman said but the lack of a major pipeline that would link growing oilsands production in alberta to markets and uncertainty about when such a pipeline will be built has pushed down prices of western canadian crude marathon oil corp had been looking to sell a

exxons port in washingtons storm if relief on the debt ceiling proves fleeting energy investors should consider hunkering down with an unloved stock exxon mobils in february exxon mobil corp sent a small robotic device known as a smart pig through a 60yearold oil pipeline in central arkansas to find cracks or other problems the next month a 22foot section of the 858milelong pegasus pipeline split open spilling 5000 barrels of crude into backyards and wetlands the cause of the accident according to a report exxon filed with regulators last month tiny cracks along the pipes lengthwise seam the torpedolike robot didnt spot them the company said this week such ruptures are rare but failures to identify small cracks are common regulators and some industry experts say smart pigs are the linchpin of the industrys efforts to monitor pipes but they arent reliable for finding all serious flaws and even when smart pigs do spot problems analyzing the reams of data collected can take months using smart pigs to find seam cracks is as close to scientific as a roulette wheel said don deaver a former exxon pipeline engineer who now works as a consultant still probing the inside of a pipeline with such devices is probably the numberone asset we have for pipeline integrity he said exxon says it follows federal guidelines for testing pipelines including assessing the seams in old pipes the detection failure in arkansas is a disappointment to us said karen tyrone vice president and operations manager for exxon mobil pipeline co we all in the industry want the tools to continue to improve the boom in us oil production is straining americas network of more than 184000 miles of pipelines carrying hazardous liquids traffic in liquidfuel pipes increased more than 19 between 2011 and 2012 according to federal data pipeline spills have risen sharply this year after two years of declines more than 93000 barrels have spilled so far exceeding last years total by 77 according to federal records the most common cause of liquid pipeline accidents since 2010 is internal corrosion according to federal records the association of oil pipe lines defended the industrys record in a statement saying it is constantly working to harness new technologies and new ways of interpreting inspection results data to identify potential issues and repair them before they become a problem pipeline operators use many tools to assess their systems including aerial surveys and excavation for direct inspections us regulations require companies to examine their pipelines that traverse residential areas and environmentally sensitive regions at least every five years using a smart pig or other method the surest way of finding flaws is to pump water into a pipe at high pressure but socalled hydrostatic tests are expensive provide just a snapshot of conditions and in some cases can enlarge minor cracks that later cause failures sections of exxons pegasus pipeline burst during a hydrostatic test in 2006 and had to be replaced the industry relies most heavily on smart pigs so named for their sophisticated sensors and porcine squeal zipping through pipes they accounted for 93 of inspections on hazardousliquids pipe in 2012 according to federal data the devices propelled by flowing oil probe with ultrasonic waves or a magnetic field pipeline companies and federal regulators have spent tens of millions of dollars over the past decade improving the technology but analyzing a smartpig scan typically takes up to nine months said stefan papenfuss vice president of pipeline resources at quest integrity group a firm that helps companies survey pipelines you can have an inspection in january but not have a full understanding of the condition of your pipeline until the following january mr papenfuss said acting on the information takes even longer smartpig scans sometimes fail to detect anomalies according to studies performed for the us pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration last year pigs are programmed to search for cracks larger than a specific length and depth but the tools sometimes miss defects that exceed those parameters according to the november 2012 study by kiefner and associates inc and det norske veritas a norwegian riskmanagement firm among the hardest flaws to detect are tiny cracks that form in seams running the length of a pipe including ones called hook cracks that doomed exxons pegasus pipeline such defects are known to occur in pipe that was fused with a lowfrequency current a process that hasnt been used since the 1970s but makes up almost a third of the nations network of hazardousliquids pipe the cracks can remain benign for decades and may never fail but internal pressure can gradually widen them in april 2012 an exxon oil pipeline in louisiana split along a seam with inferior electrical welds the 17footwide rupture leaked 2800 barrels the same kinds of cracks were blamed in the arkansas spill in march exxon said it did not receive preliminary results of the smartpig inspection until shortly after the spill but even if it had there were no indications of a problem or anything in need of repair in that section of pipe from that preliminary analysis said ms tyrone other companies have also had trouble finding flaws enbridge inc which operates north americas largest network of liquids pipelines says it boosted pipelineintegrity efforts after one of its pipelines ruptured along a seam in 2010 spilling 21000 barrels of crude and polluting michigans kalamazoo river regulators cited flaws in smartpig technology among the reasons for the accident which enbridge estimates will cost it more than 1 billion in cleanup expense and fines enbridge says it has started to conduct several kinds of tests on its pipelines more frequently it also regularly digs up sections of pipe after tests and compares the data gathered in physical studies of the pipe to better calibrate the testing equipment but accurately assessing the risk from flaws like hook cracks remains a challenge because of distortions in the metal close to the seams said trevor grams director of infrastructure integrity for enbridges liquids pipelines division because the cracks are typically along the line of the weld he said theres more of a challenge for the technology write to tom fowler at

energy companies from india and malaysia chinas cnooc ltd china national petroleum corp and china petroleum chemical corp also known as sinopec said they may bid sinopec will participate via its joint venture with spains repsol sa the decision by exxon the worlds biggest oil company and several other oil majors to skip the auction stands in contrast to the excitement over the deepwater oil strikes six years ago they were the biggest finds in the hemisphere in decadesso big that brazilian leaders made it the engine of a national strategy to lift the nation into the developed world but the oil market has changed back when brazil found the oil some experts were fretting that the worlds oil supply was destined to peak as easytoreach oil became scarce but technologies such as fracking opened up new oil frontiers also posing an alternative to brazil regions such as africa have increasingly attracted oil prospecting many in the industry are expecting longclosed mexico to invite in more oil firms but the biggest factor is brazils statedominated strategy for developing the field that puts the squeeze on profits that oil firms can make oil experts say the rules for the libra field call for an upfront fee of 7 billion a dominant role for brazils stateowned oil firm and buying equipment locally as a result the venture is more attractive to big stateoil companies such as chinas cnooc which are focused on staking claims to barrels of reserves rather than turning big profits the government cant say this was a surprise because the rules were designed to attract chinese companies said adriano pires a brazilian oil and infrastructure consultant the strategy seems to be use brazilian manpower and technology and get the state oil firms to pay for it stateowned petr leo brasileiro sa or petrobras is considered among the worlds best at deepwater oil drilling but oil majors bring a wealth of technological and management expertise as well not having their broad participation in libra could backfire if it turns out that the deepwater oil which is located beneath layers of seabed and a tricky layer of salt is harder to get than is expected in a statement exxon said it looks for opportunities where we can leverage our experience and technology and that it looks forward to evaluating other potential opportunities in brazil brazils leftwing government has had a run of infrastructure auctions for trains airports and other projects that drew fewer toptier companies than expected a muchheralded plan for a highspeed rail line between s o paulo and rio has been delayed so many times that many experts suspect it will never be built rules capping ticket prices risk making the project unprofitable all told 11 oil companies signed up to bid on a stake in the libra field and its estimated eight billion to 12 billion barrels of oil the companies who have signed up are not required to place bids in the auction which is scheduled for late october political risks hang over brazils oil industry chevron executives were angered after brazilian authorities sued the company for 20 billion and threatened to jail its local managers following a relatively small leak and quick cleanup at an offshore field it operates chevron ultimately settled for less than 50 million but the episode sent a signal that minor complications will have grave consequences for firms raising the cost of doing business in brazil meantime allegations that the us national security agency was spying on petrobras raised political issues for us companies seeking to participate in libra in nationalistic brazil a us company could be open to suspicions that it relied on espionage to make its bids us intelligence officials have vehemently denied ever giving information to corporations to help them gain a commercial advantage underscoring the political sensitivity at least one brazilian union has called for the auction round to be canceled in the wake of the nsa spying allegations development costs for the libra field are expected to be enormousmore than 400 billion reais 181 billion over the next 35 years according to brazils oil regulator the means only the largest oil companies are expected to bid analysts at credit suisse said in a report that interest in the auction was lower expected in part because oil firms are looking at opportunities in west africa the gulf of mexico and us shale gas brazil does face competition with other geographies in terms of resource the investment bank said petrobrass mandated participation could also be a deterrent the stateowned firm will automatically become a partner with the winning bidder as it is guaranteed at least a 30 financial stake in the field and status as operator petrobras also registered to participate in the

exxon earnings investors to watch for clues to output production declines and narrower profit margins unlikely to improve until 2015 hoping visitors simply wouldnt notice a chinese zoo swapped its lion for a dog this summer owners of exxon mobil corp could be forgiven for thinking the energy giant has replaced the tiger in its tank with a pussycat over the past five years the energy giants share price has lagged 46 percentage points behind a leading exchangetraded fund used to gain exposure to the oilandgas sectorquite a bit considering exxon is its largest holding thursdays thirdquarter results arent likely to help much if income from refining and marketing continues to sag during the second quarter those socalled downstream earnings collapsed to 396 million from 664 billion a year earlier tepid results earlier this week from valero energy corp a pureplay on that sector dont bode well analysts have cut their expectations for exxons thirdquarter earnings by about 8 in just the past month to 182 a share it earned 209 a year earlier exxons problem is growth or rather lack thereof management is targeting volume increases of just 2 to 3 a year in its explorationandproduction or upstream output this has lagged behind expectations in recent years theres a silver lining though through booms and busts exxon has used cash that might have gone to juicing output to reward shareholders the sums are impressive some 327 billion in payouts since oil prices bottomed in 1999about twothirds through share buybacks and the remainder from dividends thats enough to buy rival bp plc twice and have plenty of change left over what do investors get for such consistency recent subpar shareprice performance aside exxon earns superior economic returns of the sort valued by longterm shareholders its average return on invested capital over the past five years is 253well ahead that of its closest rival chevron corp that is about double the returns earned by europes four big oil companies total sa bp royal dutch shell plc and eni spa in other words exxon has reinvested fewer dollars but earned far more on them oil prices and refining margins rise and fall

thirdquarter earnings on thursday investors will be watching to see if exxons output and profit margins have stemmed their declines 2015 is going to be a pretty impressive year for production said wells fargo analyst roger read in the near term there isnt a lot they can do the company plans to add the equivalent of a million new barrels of oil a day by 2017 projecting that the increased flow will improve profit but much of that new supply is at least two years away production in the second quarter was down 73 from the same period two years earlier the trend has weighed on the oil companys shares which are roughly where they were at the start of this year that has frustrated management according to analysts who have spoken with executives exxons shares fell 12 cents to close at 8881 wednesday on the new york stock exchange mr tillerson in march told analysts he was unhappy with exxons profit per barrel we know weve got to do better than that and we can do better than that he said the irving texas companys stockmarket performance has been outmatched by smaller rival chevron corp whose fatter profit margins have helped lift its stock 10 this year exxon has dialed back spending on lessprofitable operations like drilling for gas in the us which pulls down production the company has explored selling part of its stake in an iraqi oil field and analysts say a sale is likely an exxon spokesman declined to comment the companys biggest challenge is to find new untapped deposits of oil and gas that will more than make up for the natural declines in its existing wellsand to do it without sacrificing earnings among its queue of projects a platform to extract oil from the icechoked sea of okhotsk off the russian coast and massive plants in papua new guinea and australia to chill natural gas into liquid form for export the potential payoff could be huge if exxon and its partners dont exceed their budgets for now the company is spending at the highest rate in its history investing more than 100 billion since 2011 with much of it going to multiyear projects that have yet to generate a profit that heavy spending has left exxon with less spare cash a source of investor frustration the company spent 20 billion in 2011 and 2012 buying its own shares which tends to raise their value by increasing their scarcity exxons priority for its cash after paying for operations is to raise its dividends as the company has done for 25 years with less cash left over the budget for buying shares was lowered to 3 billion in the third quarter some analysts expect that could drop to 2 billion a quarter while the company ramps up spending on projects with long lead times others believe that exxon is on the cusp of turning things around i think were in the trough right now said allen good a morningstar inc analyst adding that it could take another year to show meaningful improvement even if exxon delivers higher production isnt likely to be as profitable as it used to be

cnooc wins right to build lng export plant at canadian site canadian subsidiary of chineseowned energy giant edges out exxon mobil others calgarythe canadian subsidiary of chinese stateowned energy giant cnooc ltd has been awarded exclusive rights to proceed with a proposed terminal to export liquefied natural gas from canadas pacific coast local government and company officials said tuesday known as aurora lng the project is one of nearly a dozen proposals for plants to export surplus natural gas from british columbia none of which have been formally approved yet by their corporate sponsors in addition to calgarybased nexen inc a wholly owned unit of cnooc the project is also backed by two japanese companies oil explorer inpex corp and construction engineering firm jgc corp it comes as part of a move by canada to transform its underdeveloped northern pacific coast into a major hub for lng by using a glut of natural gas from untapped reserves inland the canadian government has also been trying to shift gas exports away from the saturated us market and into lnghungry asian markets this sole proponent agreement means that nexen has exclusive rights to move forward with planning aurora lng at grassy point british columbia premier christy clark said at a news conference the cnoocled asian consortium edged out three other possible suitors for the remote governmentowned site in northwestern canada that included competing proposals made earlier this year from exxon mobil corp and australias woodside petroleum ltd and sk e s co ltd of south korea a spokesman for

area further south along the bc coast that area already has been selected for lng terminal proposals sponsored by rivals such as chevron corp and royal dutch shell plc grassy point whose closest neighbors are the alaskan border and a remote grizzly bear sanctuary is attractive because of its proximity to asia compared with other lng hubs such as australia and the middle east the undeveloped nub of land is one of three areas along the coast earmarked for possible lng export terminals with surrounding waters deep enough to berth large ships we intend to do everything we can to responsibly and economically advance the development of a lng facility and export terminal at grassy point nexen chief executive kevin reinhart said at the news conference this is just the first step in a long

rock alone than the current output of members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries except saudi arabia exxon projects worldwide companies will pump greater amounts of oil through

crude exports in the past year royal dutch shell plc and conocophillips also have called for the us to permit crude exports such a push is likely to meet stiff resistance from energy consumers worried that exporting crude could lead to higher us fuel prices as well as those concerned about the environmental effects of increased production it could also stir opposition from companies that refine oil into gasoline and diesel and benefit from less expensive crude the us allows some oil to be shipped to canada but bans most other exports of crude some companies including exxon are already seeking to export natural gas to countries willing to pay a premium for it the us government has approved licenses for several terminals to export natural gas chilled into liquid form to countries with which it

move to curb greenhouse gases adding to its costs the oil giants outlook marks a continuing divide with environmentalists and some governments that advocate limiting fossilfuel use to curb carbon emissions warning that they trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet the international energy agency has called for a 50 reduction in oil consumption by 2050 a view exxon executives dismiss as

demand pushing domestic prices lower and eroding profit margins for energy producers exxon has long held that the same trade rules should apply to oil and gas as other products made in the us and has said that north america was pumping enough oil and gas to become an exporter but now the worlds largest investorowned energy company is explicitly calling for an end to americas effective ban on most crude exports in the past year royal dutch shell plc and conocophillips also have called for the us to permit crude exports such a push is likely to meet stiff resistance from energy consumers worried that exporting crude could lead to higher us fuel prices as well as those concerned about the environmental effects of increased production it could also stir opposition from companies that refine oil into gasoline and diesel and benefit from less expensive crude the us allows some oil to be shipped to canada but bans most other exports of crude some companies including exxon are already seeking to export natural gas to countries willing to pay a premium for it the us government has approved licenses for several terminals to export natural gas chilled into liquid form to countries with which it doesnt have a freetrade agreement exxon estimates that the world will consume 35 more energy in 2040 than in 2010 led by population growth and rising incomes in india china and other developing countries oil and gas will provide about 60 of the energy needed in 2040 compared with 7 from hydropower and other renewables it projects the company increasingly is optimistic about how much oil can

numbers dont reflect whether the oil can be produced profitably bp plc which annually publishes its own energy outlook says no one can know how much oil exists under the earths surface or how much it

liquid fuels will come from opec up from 40 in 2010 it estimates much the worlds remaining oil wont be easy or cheap to produce in its outlook exxon highlights innovations such as arctic oil platforms that can withstand icebergs and wells that extend seven miles to reach underwater crude deposits in addition the energy company projects that carbon emissions will cost 80 a ton by 2040 as governments move to curb greenhouse gases adding to its costs the oil giants outlook marks a continuing divide with environmentalists and some governments that advocate limiting fossilfuel use to curb carbon emissions warning that they trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet the international energy agency has called for a 50 reduction in oil consumption by 2050 a view exxon executives dismiss as

to full text full text exxon mobil corp the nations largest energy producer is calling for the us to lift restrictions on exporting domestic oil that date back to the arab oil embargo of 1973 the irving texas companys public support for crude exports comes as it forecasts decades of abundant supplies of petroleum in the us and elsewhere as well as increasing global demand for oil according to its annual energy outlook set to be released on thursday we are not dealing with an era of scarcity we are dealing with a situation of abundance ken cohen exxons vice president of public and government affairs said in an interview we need to rethink the regulatory scheme and the statutory scheme on the books by 2015 energy companies will tap more oil in north america from dense layers of rock alone than the current output of members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries except saudi arabia exxon projects worldwide companies will pump greater amounts of oil through 2040 and still leave nearly twothirds of the earths crude deposits untouched exxon says oil and gas are becoming more abundant exxon contends as new technologies make it possible to draw the fuels from deep under the worlds oceans oil sands deposits and tight rock formations like shale the sheer abundance of oil and gas in the us poses challenges for exxon booming production has overwhelmed us demand pushing domestic prices lower and eroding profit margins for energy producers exxon has long held that the same trade rules should apply to oil and gas as other products made in the us and has said that north america was pumping enough oil and gas to become an exporter but now the worlds largest investorowned energy company is explicitly calling for an end to americas effective ban on most crude exports in the past year royal dutch shell plc and conocophillips also have called for the us to permit crude exports such a push is likely to meet stiff resistance from energy consumers worried that exporting crude could lead to higher us fuel prices as well as those concerned about the environmental effects of increased production it could also stir opposition from companies that refine oil into gasoline and diesel and benefit from less expensive crude the us allows some oil to be shipped to canada but bans most other exports of crude some companies including exxon are already seeking to export natural gas to countries willing to pay a premium for it the us government has approved licenses for several terminals to export natural gas chilled into liquid form to countries with which it doesnt have a freetrade agreement exxon estimates that the world will consume 35 more energy in 2040 than in 2010 led by population growth and rising incomes in india china and other developing countries oil and gas will provide about 60 of the energy needed in 2040 compared with 7 from hydropower and other renewables it projects the company increasingly is optimistic about how much oil can be recovered with todays technology predicting 65 of the worlds crude will be untapped by 2040 a year ago the company estimated the world would have used less than half of its oil resources the numbers dont reflect whether the oil can be produced profitably bp plc which annually publishes its own energy outlook says no one can know how much oil exists under the earths surface or how much it will be possible to produce despite north americas surging oil output exxon projects that the biggest increase will come from the middle east by 2040 45 of the worlds supplies of oil and related

corporate news exxons profit falls as it spends more pumps less global oil majors with most of the worlds choicest reserves closed off to them have more reason than many to promote free trade and exxon mobil which called this week for the us to lift restrictions on crudeoil exports is an evangelist with especially good reason surging us oil production combined with export restrictions hold down domestic oil prices relative to global ones that enables many us refiners to capture big profits as they are allowed to export refined products like gasoline they have no interest in seeing the export ban lifted exxon is a big us refiner but it is also one of the few global integrated oilandgas majors so while us crudeoil exports would curb an advantage for its refining operations there they represented a mere 26 of its capital employed in 2012 exxon must weigh that against its upstream oilandgas fields where lifting restrictions would help relieve the glut and raise prices for domestic oil us fields represented almost a third of capital employed last year and that doesnt include its large canadian operation where due to logistical connections lifting us restrictions would also help raise prices return on capital employed or roce is a key metric for exxon not least because it spent years promoting it on wall street and as doug terreson of isi group points out exxons roce will be an estimated 18 this year down from 34 in 2008 in part that reflects the billions of dollars plowed into the illtimed acquisition of shalegas producer xto energy in 2010 one reason exxon is also seeking to export liquefied natural gas from the us exxons us upstream capital employed rose almost fourfold between 2008 and 2012 looking ahead projects in north america account for 32 of exxons new production out to 2017 according to mr terreson earning as much as possible on every one of those extra barrels will be critical to helping exxon raise its returns amplifications exxons return on capital employed or roce will be an estimated 18 this year doug terreson of isi group notes in an earlier version of this article the estimated roce was incorrectly said to be 13 credit liam denning

constraints on pipelines connecting to key markets such as asia and the us canadas output of heavy oil is expected to more than double by 2030 to over fivemillion barrels a day according to the canadian association of petroleum producers the exxon mobil subsidiary said its proposal known as aspen would be the companys first to use steamassisted gravity drainage or sagd to access up to 11 billion barrels of oil embedded in sand underground sagd and other socalled in situ extraction processes account for over half of current oil sands production with the remainder coming from open pit surface mines but the technology is needed to access 80 of the countrys overall deposits which are located far below the surface according to capp imperial uses another form of thermal extraction at its cold lake operation which it says is the largest in situ heavy oil production site in the world both aspen and cold lake are being considered for commercial production using chemical solvents to

prices are high one of the biggest problems costs are soaring for many of the new megaprojects to tap petroleum deposits needed to replenish depleting fields plans under way to pump oil using manmade islands in the caspian sea could cost a consortium that includes exxon and shell 40 billion up from the original budget of 10 billion the price tag for a naturalgas project in australia called gorgon and jointly owned by the three companies has ballooned 45 to 54 billion shell is spending at least 10 billion on untested technology to build a naturalgas plant on a large boat so the company can tap a remote field according to people who have worked on the project finding the next gusher has always been a risky business sending oil companies beneath the ocean floor and into unstable parts of africa asia and the middle east now the pursuit is trickier and more expensive than ever the easiesttoreach oil ran dry long ago and the most prolific fields often are controlled by stateowned companies in places like saudi arabia and venezuela as a result chevron exxon and shell are digging even deeper into their pockets putting their usually reliable profit margins in jeopardy exxon is borrowing more dipping into its cash pile and buying back fewer shares to help the irving texas company cover capital costs exxon has said such costs would hit about 41 billion last year up 51 from 271 billion in 2009 as they pursued the bigbet strategy the three oil giants arrived late to the shale boom in north america where they missed out on profits raked in by smaller nimbler companies that pioneered how to extract oil and gas from the dense rock the news isnt all bad combined profits at chevron exxon and shell totaled about 70 billion in 2013 according to analysts estimates exxon and shell report fourthquarter and fullyear results thursday while chevron announces its results friday in 2012 the three companies earned nearly 100 billion exxon and chevron are pressing ahead with

output started to rebound in late 2013 after a twoyear decline helped by new crude from a 13 billion oilsands project in canada the projects cost rose 2 billion since 2011 because of regulatory hurdles and permit delays in a sign of the growing pressure shell is reconsidering some investments in elephant projects that cost billions of dollars and were a key part of the companys growth strategy earlier this month shell announced its first profit warning in 10 years and has vowed to focus more on profitability than increasing its oil and gas output fullyear earnings at shell are expected to total about 168 billion down from 272 billion in 2012 net capital spending hit 443 billion in 2013 up nearly 50 from 2012 oilindustry experts say it will be difficult for the oil giants to spend less because they need to replenish the oil and gas they are pumpingand must keep up with rivals in the worldwide exploration race if you dont spend youre going to shrink says dan pickering copresident of tudor pickering holt co an investment bank in houston that specializes in the energy industry unfortunately for the oil giants though i dont think theres any way these projects are more profitable than their legacy production he adds chevron has been especially aggressive promising a 25 increase in oil and gas output by 2017 last year the san ramon calif company poured 42 billion into oil and gas projects more than double its 2010 total even though chevron is half as big as exxon or shell by annual revenue chevron plans to spend an additional 40 billion in 2014 the spending surge has drawn attention from us securities regulators who have demanded more disclosure from chevron about whether the jump will get even bigger and affect the companys liquidity chevron told regulators it will provide more details chevrons most gargantuan projects from australia to the gulf of mexico havent generated any cash flow yetand might not until next year the lag between the upfront investment in the projects and their output is pressuring chevrons bottom line analysts expect the company to report that profits fell about 20 to 21 billion in 2013 from 262 billion in 2012 the gorgon naturalgas project is one of the most extreme examples of the runaway costs that haunt chevron exxon and shell the three companies teamed up in 2009 to build the plant on an island reserve 40 miles off australias coast aiming to tap a naturalgas trove estimated at 40 trillion cubic feet gorgon could be productive for decades and feed energyhungry japan south korea and china chevron staked more than 18 billion of its own money on gorgon one of the companys biggest projects ever owns nearly half of the project and runs it exxon and shell own a 25 stake each gorgon also the name of sisters in greek mythology who had snakes in their hair and could turn beholders to stone presents unusually tough challenges the gas produced there must be piped 80 miles across a mountainous sea floor to barrow island home to so many unusual species of plants and animals that locals call it australias ark then the natural gas has to be purified and run through giant chillers that condense it into liquid form so it can be shipped on tankers barrow islands sensitive ecology meant that much of gorgons construction had to be done elsewhere with hundreds of thousands of tons of buildings and equipment disinfected and shrinkwrapped to keep out invasive species chevron executives brushed aside analysts worries about the projects cost we see a window of opportunity to move forward with gorgon timing it to capture growing market demand while benefiting from a lowering cost environment george kirkland now chevrons vice chairman said in march 2009 costs soon spiked higher labor costs rose because of fierce competition for skilled workers as other companies committed to spending more than 100 billion in similar gas projects across australia the strong australian dollar inflated the cost of materials cyclones slowed work on gorgon and forced chevron exxon and shell to build stormproof camps for workers gorgon was about halffinished in december 2012 when chevron estimated the project would cost a total of 52 billionor 40 over budget last month chevron tacked an additional 2 billion to the price tag the project now is 75 complete according to the company the economics of the gorgon project are strong says kurt glaubitz a chevron spokesman the company has struck deals to sell most of gorgons output under contracts tied to oil prices that are up about 60 since chevron committed itself to the project he adds chevron says it is working hard to keep costs in line a civilengineering unit dedicated to managing expenses and overseeing contractors has tripled to 120 employees since 2008 the company has about 62000 employees gary fischer who leads the unit and started at chevron as an intern in 1979 said at an industry conference in november that the company has

exxon chief joins lawsuit raising ruckus over fracking bartonville texasone evening last november a tall whitehaired man turned up at a town council meeting to protest construction of a water tower near his home in this wealthy community outside dallas the man was rex tillerson chairman and chief executive of exxon mobil corp he and his neighbors had filed suit to block the tower saying it is illegal and would create a noise nuisance and traffic hazards in part because it would provide water for use in hydraulic fracturing fracking which requires heavy trucks to haul and pump massive amounts of water unlocks oil and gas from dense rock and has helped touch off a surge in us energy output it also is a core part of exxons business while the lawsuit mr tillerson joined cites the side effects of fracking a lawyer representing the exxon ceo said he hadnt complained about such disturbances i have other clients who were concerned about the potential for noise and traffic problems but hes never expressed that to me or anyone else said michael whitten who runs a small law practice in denton texas mr whitten said mr tillersons primary concern is that his property value would be

least nine shale wells within a mile of the tillerson home according to texas records 360 link to full text full text bartonville texas  one evening last november a tall whitehaired man turned up at a town council meeting to protest construction of a water tower near his home in this wealthy community outside dallas the man was rex tillerson chairman and chief executive of exxon mobil corp he and his neighbors had filed suit to block the tower saying it is illegal and would create a noise nuisance and traffic hazards in part because it would provide water for use in hydraulic fracturing fracking which requires heavy trucks to haul and pump massive amounts of water unlocks oil and gas from dense rock and has helped touch off a surge in us energy output it also is a core part of exxons business while the lawsuit mr tillerson joined cites the side effects of fracking a lawyer representing the exxon ceo said he hadnt complained about such disturbances i have other clients who were concerned about the potential for noise and traffic problems but hes never expressed that to me or anyone else said michael whitten who runs a small law practice in denton texas mr whitten said mr tillersons primary concern is that his property value would be harmed an exxon spokesman said mr tillerson declined to comment the company has no involvement in the legal matter and its directors werent told of mr tillersons participation the spokesman said the dispute goes beyond possible nuisances related to fracking among the issues raised whether a water utility has to obey local zoning ordinances and what are the rights of residents who relied on such laws in making multimilliondollar property investments the latter point was the focus of mr tillersons comments at the november council meeting the tower would be almost 15 stories tall adjacent to the 83acre horse ranch mr tillerson and his wife own and a short distance from their 18acre homestead mr tillerson sat for a threehour deposition in the lawsuit last may attended an allday mediation session in september and has spoken out against the tower during at least two town council meetings according to public records and people involved with the case the exxon chief isnt the most vocal or wellknown opponent of the tower he and his wife are suing with three other couples the lead plaintiffs are former us house majority leader dick armey and his wife who have become fixtures at town council meetings mr whitten who also represents the armeys said they declined to comment the water tower is being built by cross timbers water supply corp a nonprofit utility that has supplied water to the region for half a century cross timbers says that it is required by state law to build enough capacity to serve growing demand were a high waterusage area said utility president patrick mcdonald people have large lots lawns horses cattle goats swimming pools gardens he said cross timbers said it would sell leftover supplies to energy companies during months when overall demand is low bartonvilles population has increased almost 50 since 2000 to about 1600 according to us figures mr tillerson 61 years old moved to bartonville in 2001 and became ceo in 2006 since 2007 companies have fracked at least nine shale wells within a mile of the tillerson home according to texas records the last to do so was xto energy inc in august 2009 according to texas regulators mr tillerson had just begun talks for exxon to acquire xto four months later exxon swallowed its smaller rival for 25 billion becoming americas biggest gas producer xto drills and fracks hundreds of shale wells a year and the exxon unit has said it recycles water and ships it on pipelines where feasible in part to reduce truck

prohibitively expensive to tap oil and gas according to arjuna capital an investment management firm focused on social responsibility that submitted a shareholder resolution asking for such a report exxon is set to disclose a range of measures in the report including a calculation of the carbon emissions that its operations give off and a discussion of how it incorporates the risk of regulation

chemical usage as well as damage to roads according to correspondence reviewed by the wall street journal exxons disclosures are a response to a shareholder proposal brought by the new york city comptroller and socialresponsibility advocate as you sow which agreed to withdraw the measure ahead of the companys annual meeting next month the move is hardly a surrender to environmental interests but does indicate a greater push by executives to press their case for oil and gas development at a time when public opposition to domestic drilling has unnerved some in the industry but exxons forthcoming report wont include some measures sought by the shareholders such as data on methane that leaks from its operations into the atmosphere though it agreed to explore disclosing some metrics in the future scott stringer new york citys comptroller called exxons agreement a meaningful step adding that he will continue to seek the disclosure of hard data an exxon spokesman called the agreement a productive evolution of our relationship with some of these shareholder groups earlier this week the company published reports on how it would be affected by regulations limiting carbon emissions arguing that its oil and gas reserves arent at risk the company also called on the us to allow more exports of natural gas to supplant fuels that emit more carbon abroad a policy that would help exxon as the countrys biggest gas producer the new disclosures mark a change in tone for exxon when a shareholder at the companys annual meeting in 2011 said exxon wasnt providing enough detail about its environmental performance chief executive rex tillerson responded youre just wrong last year in response to a shareholder proposal seeking a report on fracking impacts exxon said that the minimal environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing have been welldocumented and that more disclosure was unnecessary but there are signs that opposition is growing against fracking  a technique that uses a stream of water sand and chemicals to release oil and gas trapped in dense layers of rock the pew research center found that 49 of americans surveyed opposed fracking in september 2013 up from 38 last march in pennsylvania home to the natural gasrich marcellus shale the states supreme court in december ruled that towns could use zoning powers to limit where companies can drill in colorado three municipalities last year banned fracking and environmental groups are seeking to put a measure on a statewide ballot that would permit local governments to restrict it i think attitudes are shifting said fred krupp president of the environmental defense fund which worked with anadarko petroleum corp noble energy inc and encana corp in colorado to pass legislation last year curbing methane emissions from drilling in addition to exxon shareholders this year filed proposals for frackingrelated disclosures at five other companies according to as you sow one other company naturalgas producer eqt corp agreed to provide disclosure that satisfied the filers enough to withdraw the proposal we appreciated the dialogue we had with the shareholder that filed the proposal said eqt spokeswoman natalie cox we were happy to be able to supply them with the information exxon has faced a shareholder vote on the fracking resolution every year since 2010 when it acquired shalegas producer xto energy inc and became americas largest gas producer the proposal was supported by about 30 of votes cast in each of the last four years it does feel like exxon is changing the way its doing business said danielle fugere president of as you sow but if the companys disclosure report disappoints we did reserve our right to bring a resolution next year

research center to be based in st petersburg russia in return the us company gets a 33 stake in kara sea and black sea prospects as well as a 49 interest in a pilot program to test the potential of rock buried beneath siberias tundra rosneft acquired a 30 stake in some of exxons properties in the gulf of mexicos deep waters the two companies are planning to build a plant to export natural gas

text exxon mobil corp is pushing ahead with plans to drill in russias arctic seas  its biggest opportunity to discover untapped deposits of oil and gas  even though deteriorating relations between moscow and washington have increased the risks americas biggest energy producer is set this summer to tap what it calls the university prospect in the arctics kara sea a trove that could hold the equivalent of 9 billion barrels of oil  more than a third of exxons proven reserves that prize looks riskier as tensions increase between the west and moscow over russias incursion in ukraine us sanctions this week targeted igor sechin a close associate of president vladimir putin and head of oao rosneft exxons kremlincontrolled partner in the arctic the sanctions didnt extend to rosneft itself all of the activities that we had originally planned for this year are under way david rosenthal exxons vice president of investor relations said thursday of exxons plans with rosneft exxon will comply with all sanctions he said exxon has little choice but to stick with russia experts say the companys firstquarter production fell 56 from a year earlier the latest in a series of declines over the last decade and it has to replace the fuels it pumps every year by rosnefts estimates a quarter of the worlds remaining oilandgas reserves lie buried beneath russiancontrolled soil that makes the country hard to ignore especially as governments of other oilrich countries favor their statecontrolled energy companies exxon executives take the longterm view that hopefully they can weather the nearterm storm said charles ebinger director of the energy security initiative at the brookings institution exxon and rivals such as bp plc and royal dutch shell plc dont have a lot of choice theyve been denied access to a lot of the promising acreage in the world he said the irving texas companys most profitable barrels lie outside of the us partly because exxon hasnt fared well in the us energy boom it jumped into the us shale frenzy with a 25 billion acquisition of xto energy inc in 2010 just before naturalgas prices tumbled exxon chief executive rex tillerson has pledged to improve the companys profit margins last year the company sold some of its stake in an iraqi project allowed a lessprofitable concession in abu dhabi to lapse and continued to reduce spending on gas drilling in north america that pruning combined with a focus on adding more crude from places such as canadas oil sands is beginning to pay off despite lower output exxons profit from tapping oil and gas jumped 11 in the first quarter from a year earlier the results were helped by higher naturalgas prices and a steep drop in capital spending to 84 billion the lowest in three years the companys firstquarter profit fell 42 to 91 billion hurt by weak refining margins exxons shares fell 1 to close at 10141 thursday but from the first round of us sanctions more than a month ago through wednesday exxons shares had climbed 86 far outpacing the broader market and adding 34 billion to the companys value the rise partly reflects that exxon faces little risk in the shortterm russia accounted for about 1 of the companys output last year and exxon has yet to invest the years and billions of dollars it would take to unearth the arctics energy riches the areas of the kara sea where exxon and rosneft are exploring could hold billions of barrels of oil the companies have said it could be decades before the partners can coax meaningful amounts of crude from beneath the frozen sea which is icebound for most of the year 
corporate news exxon unit in canada seeks deep arctic well calgaryexxon mobil corps canadian subsidiary is considering plans for what would be the deepest offshore well ever drilled in the arctic increasing some environmentalists concerns about how the company would respond to a blowout imperial oil ltd submitted a project description last september to canadian regulators for a proposed exploratory well so deep that it would likely take two to four years to complete the well could extend about 6 miles beneath the floor of the beaufort sea according to a study commissioned by the pew charitable trusts an environmental watchdog imperials filing didnt specify a well depth but the unpublished pew study prepared by a thirdparty engineering consultant calculated it as roughly 34000 feet these wells may be drilled over 6 miles deep and will need complex well casing cementing and drilling plans to address the technical challenges of drilling deep high pressure wells the report said a spokesman for imperial said friday that drilling depths would vary and wouldnt be spelled out until a formal application is made but that geological targets would likely be at a maximum depth of 24606 feet or about 47 miles the leases where the proposed well would be drilled are in the canadian arctic about 110 miles off the coast of the northwest territories town of tuktoyaktuk imperial

on the png lng project in 2010 when asian gas users were looking to increase imports of fuels that burn more cleanly than coal and international energy companies were struggling to gain access to resources not owned by foreign governments the industrys landscape has changed dramatically since then north american companies now are looking to export shale gas and china in recent days signed a

ferneyhough the calgary alberta companys vice president for asiapacific operations the us calculates that the south china sea likely holds nearly 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas there is a problem proceeding with drilling could bring talisman into conflict with china which claims some of the blocks as its own talisman declined to comment on chinas position mr ferneyhough accepts vietnams assurances that talisman has the right to explore there for years the drive to tap the south china seas potential riches has placed global oil companies in the center of a quarrel between china and vietnam over which country owns the resources companies that have gotten caught up include exxon mobil corp chevron corp conocophillips co and bp plc in may tensions flared anew when stateowned china national offshore oil corp sailed a billiondollar oil rig into waters claimed by vietnam prompting a standoff between chinese and vietnamese government vessels on tuesday china said it had completed drilling for now and was withdrawing the rig from the waters in a potential easing of the standoff but chinas foreign ministry left the door open to future exploration

additional well this year as it evaluates a multibilliondollar naturalgas project in vietnam a company spokeswoman said disputes of sovereignty are for governments to resolve and declined to comment on the status of its drilling plans there the standoff over which companies can drill and where represents a test of the obama administrations ability to convince china to dial back recent confrontations with vietnam and the philippines without damaging wider uschina ties the us also fears chinese control over contested waters could one day impede the ability of its forces to operate there say observers secretary of state john kerry pressed chinese officials on the issue during a visit to beijing last week the us has taken moderate steps to heighten pressure on beijing in recent months over its sea disputes daniel russel assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs said in congressional testimony in february that chinas claims over nearly the entire south china sea had no apparent basis in international law china flatly rejects what it sees as us meddling in its territorial disputes senior us diplomats have rarely made public reference to the challenges faced by us companies in the south china sea a state department official declined to offer details on how the us and china have dealt with the matter adding the us supported expanding economic ties between the us and vietnam the size of chinas energy market and the growing global clout of its oil companies give it some unique strength in dealings with international oil firms for

exxon mobil starts to sputter investors could be forgiven for wondering if the tiger has left this tank it shouldnt be surprising that the return on exxon mobil corps shares including dividends has been about half that of the broad stock market since oil prices peaked in july 2008 management cant control commodity markets after all more dismaying is that the stock has badly lagged behind domestic rivals over the same period exxons fans have answers to such criticism for one the company has been a careful steward of cash from 2009 through 2013 the companys return on invested capitaleffectively its bang for the buckhas been far higher than at other integrated oilandgas companies and despite glacial growth in absolute terms its oilandgas output measured on a pershare basis has grown far more quickly than its rivals per share is the caveat because exxon has been a furious buyer of its own stock to the tune of 84 billion over five years shareholders tiring of exxons schtick will await more detail when it reports secondquarter results thursday at its annual meeting this spring exxon cut guidance for output without making a similar adjustment to capitalexpenditure projections that means less bang for future bucks so while an expected 188 in earnings per share for the quarter compared with 155 a year ago would be welcome anxiety about future profitability has grown in fairness exxon earned its reputation for being a wise spender of shareholders money over many years both good and bad for the energy industry having the discipline to walk away from a marginal project or deal and leaving it to competitors mostly served shareholders well but in recent years exxon arguably has been too cautious in some cases and foolhardy in others a prime example of the latter was the 31 billion purchase of xto energy in 2010 which added lots of naturalgas reserves in a stillglutted north american market that deal buoyed otherwise faltering output earnings not so much meanwhile analysts lament how exxon has missed out on some of the worlds hottest oil and gas patches and increasingly question its moderate valuation premium to peers once seen as the smoothestrunning machine in big oil exxon suddenly doesnt look so slick 
cashpoor venezuela weighs sale of citgo petroleos de venezuela also considers a sale of its stake in a refinery run with exxon mobil venezuela strapped for cash at home and staring down costly litigation overseas is considering a deal for its usbased refinery company citgo petroleum corp as well as a stake in a refinery run with exxon mobil corp according to a citgo document and people familiar with the matter people close to petroleos de venezuela sa or pdvsa say the staterun oil giant is in the early stages of considering a deal for houstonbased citgo which operates three refineries it is separately shopping its 50 stake in the chalmette refinery in louisiana a process that is further advanced they said a july 15 bond prospectus for citgo states that pdvsa is currently seeking to monetize its ownership interest in us a spokesman for pdvsa said he had no information on any potential asset sales exxon also declined to comment pdvsa the principal source of hard currency in venezuela is seeking to bolster the countrys stumbling economy redirect more oil exports from the us to its top creditor china and get some protection from the seizure of foreign assets as settlements in disputes before the world bank draw near analysts said but any potential deal might easily get snagged on issues like price they warned venezuela has periodically mulled unloading citgo over the years but faced the same struggle it is confronted with now the difficulty of finding a buyer and getting enough in return to justify the move anthony szabo a former pdvsa executive who maintains ties with the investment community and among intermediaries who work with venezuelas government said that three offers by unknown prospective buyers had been made to pdvsa some analysts estimate that the most pdvsa stands to make from a sale of citgo is between 8 and 10 billion companies like marathon petroleum corp and valero energy corp would face antitrust headwinds while the majors in europe and the us are hesitant to deal with venezuelas antiwest government co analyst fadel gheit said several companies might be interested in some of citgos assets but few would be willing to take on the whole company citgos refineries include facilities in lake charles la corpus christi texas and lemont ill with a combined processing capacity of about 760000 barrels a day i just doubt any company would want to buy a million barrels of capacity he said there are about 5600 independently owned and operated citgobranded retail outlets that wont be a part of any sale pdvsa completed its purchase of citgo from southland corp in 1990 co analyst sam margolin said citgos midstream assetsdock space pipelines and storage terminalsmight be highly sought after many midstream companies are structured as master limited partnerships and some refiners have launched partnerships of their own in recent years that corporate structure can make raising money for large acquisitions an easier task any consideration to sell citgo comes from venezuelas cash crunch as well as concern over upcoming rulings by the world banks international centre for settlement of investment disputes or icsid that could result in liens on citgo assets theyre going to lose the arbitration hearings said mr szabo president of stone bond technologies in houston theyll lose so these assets can be frozen conocophillips and exxon mobil both entered arbitration requests before the icsid in response to the venezuelan governments 2007 nationalization of projects in the oilrich orinoco region estimates of potential settlements against venezuela vary but experts say the socialist country will likely be ordered to compensate the us companies a total of 10 billion venezuela is looking under couch cushions for coins because they need money said russ dallen head of caracas capital markets the exxon and conocophillips judgments are coming any day now and the easiest place to enforce those judgments will be the united states soon after venezuela president nicolas maduro was elected to office last year the country of 29 million residents began to endure a strangling scarcity of dollars which has created widespread shortages in an economy that depends on imports for just about everything other than oil critics of the government say the scarcity comes from high inflation and an overvalued currency but the government blames the opposition and outside forces for trying to sabotage the economy venezuela has turned to china for loans totaling more than 50 billion in mostly oilforcredit swaps but has been stretched thin as pdvsa output sags by closing citgo they would free up a lot of oil going to the united states and continue to service china said thomas odonnell a visiting energy professor at the freie university in berlin and an expert on the venezuelan oil industry but that is ultimately robbing peter to pay paul they need to raise production argus media earlier reported that pdvsa is weighing a sale of citgo and the chalmette refinery stake as for the refineries mr margolin said some existing independent refiners might want to take bigger positions on the us gulf coast where much of the output from shale formations is building up us refineries that have changed hands in recent years have commanded lower prices than what pdvsa might be seeking marathon last year agreed to pay about 24 billion for bps 475000 barreladay refinery in texas city texas and in 2013 bp sold its carson refinery in southern california to tesoro corp in a deal valued at 24 billion

us readies new energy sanctions on russia move could imperil existing ties between exxon and rosneft washingtonthe us is close to imposing the toughest round of energy sanctions so far on russia measures that would also hit western companies like exxon mobil that are working with russian statecontrolled oil companies the sanctions which the european union is expected to match would ban energy companies from working with russia on future oil exploration in the russian arctic deep seas and shale rock formations according to a us official the sanctions wouldnt affect current oil production but could imperil the future of existing partnerships including a deal between exxon mobil corp and oao rosneft the kremlincontrolled oil giant to drill in the arctic ocean previous sanctions banned only the export of technology that could be used in such projects other companies potentially affected include bp plc and royal dutch shell plc itll deny them some contracts for sure but it hurts russia a lot more the us official said referring to western energy companies this puts their future economic growth in danger the us official cautioned that the deal isnt final and may not ever be adopted depending in part on actions by the eu and whether the ceasefire that took effect friday between prorussia separatists and ukraine holds a spokeswoman for the treasury department which takes the lead on us sanctions declined to comment elizabeth rosenberg a former treasury official who helped implement sanctions on irans oil industry said that such a move if enacted would be extremely significant and would directly impact a number of western companies that partner with russian companies to offset declining output from older traditional wells russiaone of the worlds biggest oilproducing countriesis seeking to develop oil fields that are difficult to reach which often requires cooperation with western companies the russian companies that would be affected by this are large companies that generate substantial revenue for the russian government and they require partnership with western companies for technology and access to capital said ms rosenberg who is now a senior fellow at the center for new american security a washingtonbased think tank a rosneft spokeswoman declined to comment exxon and rosneft are drilling now in the kara sea before october when ice will make the arctic waters unnavigable the arctic exploration exxon and rosneft are doing if successful wouldnt generate meaningful production for years exxon shares fell sharply in aftermarket trading when the news initially broke on wednesday though settled at a loss of 06 to 9681 the eu this week approved this new round of sanctions against moscow which includes these energy sanctions but it has held off enacting them while kiev works with moscow on a solution to end fighting with separatists in ukraines eastern regions a meeting wednesday in brussels ended without agreement eu officials were to reconvene thursday some countries including finland slovakia and cyprus are arguing that there has been an improvement in the situation in ukraine since the ceasefire and that the bloc should wait to see how it evolves others such as the uk germany and poland argue the eu should enact the sanctions as promised but lay out clear conditions under which they could be rolled back the issue is now to publish them and therefore enforce them german chancellor angela merkel told the lower house of parliament in berlin earlier in the day italian foreign minister federica mogherini soon to become the eu foreign policy chief said in brussels that the issue may have to go back to eu leaders before a final decision can be made the us eu and other western countries have imposed sanctions on russia this year after moscow moved to annex ukraines crimea region officials in the us and other countries say russias military is participating in fighting inside ukraine a charge the kremlin denies the latest sanctions would increase the concerns of business groups that worry that the us efforts to punish moscow are starting to hurt the prospects of global firms significantly business groups also worry that stricter sanctions will lead russians to reject western brands doing longterm harm to consumerfocused firms that arent directly affected by the sanctions and arent facing retaliation from russian officials russia which has a much smaller less diversified economy compared with the us and eu has threatened to respond asymmetrically to the next round of sanctions perhaps by banning western flights over its territory which would hit european airlines and us freight firms us officials say theyre working hard to minimize any boomerang effect of the sanctions many of the restrictions so far have targeted russian companies access to global financial markets dominated us lenders and others that use the dollar according to documents reviewed by the wall street journal the latest eu sanctions which havent been implemented would further limit the international financing of three russian energy firms oao gazpromneft the oil arm of russias naturalgas giant pipeline operator oao transneft and rosneft five statecontrolled banks including giants oao sberbank and vtb group would also face tighter eu restrictions that cut their ability to borrow in europe to 30 days from 90 days in a previous round of sanctions the us is expected to match the eu with similar financial restrictions the united states is finalizing measures to both deepen and broaden our sanctions across russias financial energy and defense sectors state department spokeswoman marie harf said tuesday were making our decisions on our own timeline but obviously coordinating very closely with the eu

wont hurt exxon in the near term the amount spent on exploring the arctics kara sea is relatively small for exxon and it wont be able to pump significant amounts of oil or gas there for years but if

in the russian arctic and had planned to stop drilling in october in order to remove equipment and personnel before winter set in exxon said it has received a license from the us treasury department for more time to wind down operations safely and close up the project before winter to ensure a safe and environmentally responsible completion said exxon spokesman richard keil the license is nonrenewable and no further work is permitted unless the sanctions remain in place for many more months they are not expected to lead to a delay in the kara sea exploration project the project is part of a broad collaboration between exxon and the kremlincontrolled rosneft russias largest oil company the two aim to explore for oil and gas in technically challenging formations in russia these formations are thought to hold large troves of hydrocarbons but producing oil from them requires the type of expertise found at western oil companies such as exxon even if successful the projects

petroleum corp the sanctions were designed to punish russia for its aggression in ukraine us officials have said the penalties could be lifted if there is evidence that the kremlin was complying with

and gas total meanwhile is relying on the yamal project which is expected to start up in 2017 to provide a big chunk of the companys production growth yamal is estimated to hold proven reserves of 800 million barrels of oil equivalent us and european union sanctions include financing limits on some banks and energy companies and restrictions on technology transfers and equipment to develop offshore arctic oil and onshore shale oil the latest round of sanctions added to asset freezes and travel bans on dozens of russian officials and executives including one of novateks biggest shareholdersgennady timchenko yamal is a complex project requiring western technology that russia lacks such as the liquefaction plant that will supercool natural gas into liquid so it can be transported in tankers the project has managed to proceed despite the sanctions because the companies involved have been able to pursue other avenues for financing russia relies on oil and gas to

exxon rosneft find oil and gas at arctic well us sanctions raise questions about how the companies will exploit the resources they have found exxon mobil corp and russias oao rosneft have found major amounts of oil and natural gas at their first well in the arctic rosneft said saturday offering a glimpse of the potential buried beneath the icestudded waters north of siberia but the news raised questions about how rosneft and exxon will exploit the resources they have found us sanctions imposed earlier this month bar companies from providing goods services and technology for arctic oil projects among other types of drilling in russia exxon a week ago acknowledged the impact of the sanctions as it confirmed that it was winding down drilling of the university1 well in the kara sea we have encountered hydrocarbons but it is premature to speculate on any potential outcome regarding the university1 exploration well alan jeffers an exxon spokesman said saturday rosneft said geological data from the well was still being analyzed to come up with an estimate of the resource but the company touted the early indications saying it wanted to name the field pobeda or victory in russian this is an outstanding result of the first exploratory drilling on a completely new offshore field igor sechin rosnefts chief executive said in a statement rosneft praised other western partners including schlumberger ltd halliburton co and weatherford international plc the arctic is estimated to hold some of the worlds largest deposits of oil and gas that have yet to be tapped exxon and rosneft in 2011 struck a deal to explore russias arctic waters expanding it to cover an area larger than texas the companies have estimated the exploration costs alone will exceed 32 billion with exxon footing most of the tab the university1 well in the kara sea is the first well the companies have drilled in the partnership the results however wont have an immediate impact on exxon or rosneft even without sanctions it would likely take years for the companies to pump meaningful amounts of oil and gas for exxon the deal represents one of its best longterm opportunities to find new sources of oil and gas to replace what it pumps for russia tapping the arctics energy riches is part of a strategy to increase domestic production a mainstay of its economy and geopolitical clout us and european officials have imposed sanctions to crimp russias ability to develop the arctic and other new energy resources such as a giant shalerock formation in siberia the measures are designed to punish the kremlin for stoking a military conflict in ukraine western officials have said a rosneft spokeswoman didnt immediately respond to a request for comment on the impact of us sanctions on developing the discovered oil and gas 
exxon delays some work because of ebola company puts some drilling on hold off west africa the ebola outbreak in west africa has led to exxon mobil corp delaying some of its drilling plans in the region including work off the coast of liberia the company has prohibited travel for some of its employees to countries plagued by ebola and put some activity on hold said rex tillerson chief executive of exxon he was in houston on thursday to speak at an industry event we had some drilling plans for some blocks offshore in west africa and liberia and in that area mr tillerson said we are having to look at when it would be prudent to resume operations there because you do have to have shorebased operations you have to have people going in and out the company has also taken some precautionary measures with nonessential personnel most particularly some of the spouses and children who are with employees that live in west africa he said exxons pandemic response plan dates back to the sars outbreak in asia exxon acquired an 80 stake in an oil prospect off the coast of liberia in april 2013 it has spent more than a year planning and preparing to drill with its partner canadian overseas petroleum the company also has african operations in nigeria angola and equatorial guinea 
exxon mobil awarded 16 billion in venezuela case world bank court rules country didnt compensate oil company fairly for expropriated assets caracasthe world banks international arbitration court awarded exxon mobil corp 16 billion on thursday in its case against the venezuelan government over assets expropriated in 2007 the unanimous decision by a panel at the international center for settlement of investment disputes is a far cry from the 166 billion that the us oil major had sought for the nationalization of its cerro negro project but the judgment comes at a troubling time for venezuela whose leftist government is facing hardcurrency shortages that have led to investor concerns over its ability to pay overseas debt on the one side venezuela comes out standing tall from this decision however its also negative because they have serious cash flow problems said asdrubal oliveros head of caracasbased economic consultancy ecoanalitica venezuela hailed the result calling it reasonable once again the bolivarian republic of venezuela its government institutions and workers have confronted and have been able to defeat the aggressions of the powerful transnational interests the foreign ministry said in a statement the exxon case is one of the largest of more than 20 claims against the south american nation at the icsid court demanding compensation for assets seized during a nationalization spree spearheaded by the late socialist president hugo ch vez the leader took over scores of companies to secure greater control over key economic sectors especially its vital oil industry the administration of his successor president nicol s maduro will have to pay 14 billion to exxon for seizing a 417 stake in the cerro negro project the operation involved plying heavy oil from the countrys vast and resourcesrich orinoco region and processing it into a lighter grade of crude exxon has said it cost 31 billion to build and operate the facilities between 1997 and 2007 in addition exxon was awarded 179 million for the takeover of the la ceiba project as well as interest david eglinton an exxon spokesman said the nationalization was clearly not a desirable outcome the tribunals decision however confirms that the venezuela government failed to provide fair compensation for expropriated assets he said venezuela however will be able to deduct 908 million that was awarded to exxon in a 2012 verdict passed down by the parisbased international chamber of commerce over the assets at the end the country is likely to have to pay around 11 billion estimated joe kogan an emergingmarket strategist at scotiabank who has been closely tracking the mounting arbitration cases against venezuela not paying would be the equivalent of defaulting on the bonds he said the award if it is paid wouldnt have a major impact on exxons finances the oil giant whose 438 billion in sales last year were equivalent to venezuelas gross domestic product had recorded the value of its cerro negro investment at 750 million but venezuela will still likely try to use legal challenges to delay compensation and to negotiate settlements with claimants that include bonds and oil assets given its severe liquidity constraints said risa graistargow an analyst at the risk consultancy eurasia group president maduro has seen his popularity plummet this year as the countrys dollar crunch has forced it to scale back on payments to the private companies that service its economy ranging from medicine and machinery importers to airlines residents as a result struggle with chronic shortages of food and basic consumer goods like shampoo at the same time venezuela which relies on oil for 96 of dollar revenue saw the price of its basket of crude and petroleum products drop to a morethan threeyear low as of friday the last time the oil ministry reported prices the country earlier this year said that it was looking to sell its us refining unit citgo for at least 10 billion recently the icsid court awarded 740 million to gold reserve a spokane washingtonbased mining company whose project was taken over by the government a decision in the largest of the claims against the countrywhich was filed by houstonbased energy company conocophillipsis expected around the end of this year investors in venezuelan bonds werent comforted this week when the country had to dip into its international reserves to pay off 15 billion in maturing bonds in the coming two months it has an addition sum of nearly 5 billion to pay in debt for which venezuela has to offer the highest yields in the developing world due to the perceived risk thats not a good sign of a nations finances said russell dallen a partner at brokerage caracas capital markets if venezuela refuses to pay the exxon award the judgment is enforceable in any of the countries that belong to the world bank forum but exxon would not have to go far mr dallen said noting that exxon has a refinery joint venture with pdvsa in chalmette louisiana at the moment its like splitting up with someone but still having to go to work with that ex ezequiel minaya contributed to this article an earlier version had an

exxon shell carbon emissions rise though pumping drops greenhousegas increase reflects difficulty in tapping new sources of energy exxon mobil corp and royal dutch shell plc are emitting more carbon dioxide despite tapping less oil and natural gas for every barrel they pump the two biggest western oil companies generated 10 more in greenhouse gases each last year than they did in 2011 according to company data the rise in such emissions which trap heat in the atmosphere in part stems from the mounting difficulty of getting oil and gas out of the ground much of the energy companies new production comes from projects that consume a lot of fuel such as cooling natural gas to a liquid state for transport or heating and processing oil that is too heavy to flow on its own exxon and shell are among hundreds of big firms that provided data on their emissions to the nonprofit carbon disclosure project the reports reviewed by the wall street journal are set for release wednesday exxon in its report said it improved energy efficiency in refining and manufacturing by 10 and 12 respectively between 2002 and 2012 the company said it hasnt set a target for curbing emissions because such measures arent effective in managing climate risks exxon mobil is taking action by working to reduce greenhousegas emissions in its operations helping consumers reduce their emissions supporting research and contributing to policy discussions a spokesman said the energy companies use slightly different methodologies to calculate their emissions exxon for example relied on a more recent measurement by an international climatechange panel than its peers which the company said contributed to a higher emissions figure for last year still the company acknowledges that pumping oil and gas today generates more emissions than in the past its a disturbing trend said sister patricia daly executive director of the tristate coalition for responsible investment a network of investors focused on social and environmental issues the rise in emissions reinforces the need for targets on reducing carbon she said the coalition has filed proposals on behalf of exxon shareholders asking the company to set targets for curbing greenhousegas emissions the latest proposal in june received support from 22 of the shareholder vote shell attributed its emissions increase to producing oil and gas that requires more energy to access as well to lower production in nigeria because of theft shell in its report projected that its direct emissions would rise in coming years as our business grows and production becomes more energy intensive the company said it takes reducing greenhousegas emissions seriously it cited a canadian project that will capture a million tons of carbon beginning next year a large biofuels portfolio and investments in fuels such as natural gas other major western oil companies have avoided big increases in carbon emissions bp plcs emissions from production decreased 06 between 2011 and 2013 the companys oil and gas output has fallen sharply since 2010 after selling operations in the wake of gulf of mexico oil spill and its emissions have fallen by a similar degree bp didnt respond to a request for comment chevron corp the secondbiggest us oil company behind exxon generated 4 less emissions per barrel last year than in 2011 it is alone among its peers in setting a goal for carbon emissions this year 175 higher than last year the company cited new facilities that are expected to go online and the resumption of operations at facilities that had been idled chevron recognizes and shares the concerns of governments and the public about climate change a spokesman said exxons global operations generated the equivalent of 148 million metric tons of carbon last year the figure combines the carbon exxon emits directly from its own sources as well as indirectly by consuming energy generated by others the total rose slightly from 2012 because of emissions from chemical manufacturing and a methodology change even though emissions from refining fell nearly half of exxons emissions comes from tapping oil and gas which accounts for 90 of the companys earnings though production fell 61 between 2011 and 2013 total emissions from pumping increased 37 exxon noted the trend in higher emissions from oil and gas production in a report earlier this year and said the performance was undesirable the company in recent years has moved to address the risks of climate change cutting back on burning natural gas that is unprofitable to capture and eliminating steps in processing heavy crude in canada exxon also has published two reports on climate earlier this year in response to shareholder concerns in the reports exxon recognized that climate change poses risks to its business but said its projects were necessary to meet growing demand as exxon searches to replenish the oil and gas it pumps much of its new production takes a lot of energy to tap heavy oil which must be processed extensively makes up 17 of exxons proven reserves that is up from 15 two years ago shell also has added significant reserves in canadas oil sands the company said it invested in equipment to conserve heat generated from its carmon creek oilsands project which helped keep emissions in check the company decided against a plan to capture and store carbon underground the scale of investment wouldnt have been economic shell said

scary halloween for exxon chevron even after crude price drop more trouble awaits oil majors it is fitting that oil majors exxon mobil corp and chevron corp are releasing thirdquarter results on halloween energy investors are downright spooked by the rapid drop in crude prices in the past several weeks while the immediate blow to those companies bottom lines may be glancing next year looks scary at todays prices reflecting that exxon and chevron have trailed the s p 500 by 10 and 13 respectively in the past three months analysts see exxon earning 173 a share down from 179 a year ago in large part due to sagging production the loss of a concession in the united arab emirates compounded those woes output in the second quarter fell by 57 year over year chevrons earnings are seen increasing slightly to 262 a share from 257 last year expectations for 2015 have been dropping steadily for both compared with projections last august analyst forecasts for exxons earnings for next year are 16 lower today forecasts for chevrons are down 22 the reason for the difference may be that exxon is less oily these days that is particularly so following its mammoth deal for north american gas producer xto energy inc announced in december 2009 until recently that had weighed on exxon due to a glutted naturalgas market even if crude prices stabilize at todays levels earnings expectations for both companies are likely to continue drifting lower as brokers fully reflect those prices in 2015 forecasts the sensitivity of either companys cash flow to a fall in oil prices from 100 to 85 depends on a host of factors peculiar to their individual businesses but history shows the impact can be drastic in 2009 when prices dropped much more sharply and a global recession was under way exxons operating cash flow dropped by 31 billion and chevrons fell by 27 billion back then each company was able to maintain dividends and even planned capital expenditures but both slashed share buybacks those have since recovered with exxon and chevron reducing their share counts by more than 14 and 5 respectively since 2010 in exxons case that has helped mitigate the sting of weak production by boosting pershare output and earnings without that trick there will be fewer goodies with which to treat investors

arbitration panel ordered a texas advisory firm to pay a group of 19 retired exxon mobil corp employees a total of 38 million for losses from an alleged failed investment strategy designed to protect them from stockmarket downturns the retirees invested nearly 40 million with us capital advisors llc of houston and contended that they could have made 3 million from the strategy as it was described to them by advisers with the firm instead they lost 125 million according to their arbitration claim with the financial industry regulatory authority the panel awarded them a combined 19 million in damages plus interest along with 852630 in punitive damages and almost 1 million in legal and other costs according to the award posted on finras website individually the damage awards ranged from 28294 to 195949 finra arbitrators usually dont explain the reasoning for their decisions but in this case they did saying they found egregious recurrent and willful violations of a fiduciary relationship between us capital advisors and the investors many of the claimants put money into the strategy at the recommendation of a group of advisers who targeted exxon mobil employees nearing retirement with investment seminars the advisers originally worked for ubs ag and the clients stayed with them when they left that firm to join newly created us capital advisers in 2010 the total return strategy the investors were told would hold mainly us stocks and exchangetraded funds in a rising market and move the money into cash when markets fell with trades triggered by objective technical indicators according to the claim but when the advisers left ubs their new firm was understaffed and illequipped to execute the strategy and they strayed from the model the claim said asked for comment on the award patrick mendenhall the chief executive of us capital advisors defended his firm he said the clients claim focused only on the losses from the total return strategy but ignored gains from other investments we are clearly disappointed with the award we certainly dont understand it he said thomas fulkerson a houston lawyer who represented the retirees with his partner wesley lotz said financial advisers cant argue that advisers who make money in one client accounts would have immunity for the losses in other accounts he said the panel asked for a specific briefing about the argument we are gratified by the award he said

exxon mobil shale to the chief falling costs in us shale drilling present a major headwind to oil price rallies exxon mobil prides itself on consistency the oil majors analyst meeting on wednesday was the 13th one straight to be hosted at the new york stock exchange ceo rex tillerson is told that this makes exxons meeting the longestrunning at the venue exxon evidently hopes to echo this with its latest strategic outlook it plans to cut investment this year by about 12 to a still chunky 34 billion that underpins a plan to grow production by 24 a year to 43 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2017 that would mark a turnaround given that production has dropped since 2011 still it is modest by historical standards output in 2017 will be only slightly higher than in 2006 when mr tillerson took the helm one constituency wont be pleased oilfield services firms with oil prices lower exxon aims to raise output while keeping its budget in check one way it aims to do this is by negotiating better terms with mr tillerson saying we expect lower contractor fees expect exxon to stick with that message petroleum industry oil reserves company  organization name exxon mobil corp

oil inventories continues indeed tanks at cushingthe big pipeline hub in oklahomaare twothirds full already according to energy department data released this week think of that as a giant bucket filling up above the heads of oil investors but there is an even bigger bucket out there big oil on the same day the inventory figures came out exxon mobil was giving its annual strategy presentation in new york and chief executive rex tillerson had some pretty bearish things to say on oil in particular while he didnt see a perfect parallel between shale gas and shale oil he said there were lessons to be learned the drop in oil prices has prompted 39 of us oil rigs to be idled since october stoking expectations of a rebound in the market yet mr tillerson pointed out that the collapse in naturalgas prices similarly had led the number of rigs drilling for that fuel to drop to 280 from north of 1600 in 2008 gas output jumped 50 in that time he said that is what you call resilience the more insidious message concerned what exxon hadnt been doing in recent years namely ramping up its own north american shaleoil output in 2010 exxon plunged into shale with the acquisition of xto energy back then it had about 12 rigs drilling in three big shale basins the permian the woodford and the bakken five years on that has risen but only to about 45 the company says why such gradualism rather than chase nearterm cash flow mr tillerson said exxon has been putting itself through shale class learning how to get the most out of these rocks in the most costefficient way that represents a bearish trend that will weigh on oil prices for years to come exxon says its costs in the bakken have dropped by 20 to 25 so many prospects that made sense at 100abarrel oil still make sense now the company says this gives exxon along with its peers a base of resources from which it can grow production profitably that is even if as now lower oil prices force delays in advancing the big ticket multiyear projects such as liquefied natural gas that the majors are usually known for indeed roughly half the increase in output that exxon targets by 2017 is expected to come from us onshore wells exxon isnt alone the smaller companies making up the exploration and production sector were the true shale pioneers and while as of feb 20 the e p sector had slashed capitalexpenditure budgets by 39 on average according to tudor pickering holt output is still expected to rise by 5 this year inventories should be a concern for investors right now but it is the marriage of shale resources with the likes of exxons longstanding focus on cutting costs that presents the bigger headwind to oil rallies write to liam denning at  liamdenningwsjcom

exxon suit highlights energy cost fears oil giant alleges russian venture suffered from platform contractors mistakes when exxon mobil corp in january started pulling oil from beneath the icebound waters off russias eastern coast the project was over budget and a year behind schedule the troubles likely would have remained out of public view had exxon not sued contractor worleyparsons ltd the spat offers a rare glimpse of the challenges and sniping behind one of the worlds most complicated oil developments as soaring costs and falling crude prices have bedeviled the energy industry the project known as arkutundagi called for building one of the largest offshore drilling platforms in the world designed to withstand extreme winds waves and earthquakes that shake the seabed beneath the icy sea of okhotsk oil began flowing in january and is expected to reach up to 90000 barrels a day exxon claims the australian contractor made so many mistakes designing the platform that the work took 27 million manhours more than originally estimated and delayed the project by a year according to a lawsuit in the supreme court of new york the scope of worleyparsons errors is staggering exxon said in its complaint citing pipes that didnt fit together and gaps between the platforms walls and the deck floor contending defects were hidden so the firm could land another contract with exxon worleyparsons denies this saying exxons complaint is replete with unfounded spurious allegations the contractor says it didnt commit to a fixed deadline or price and that exxon decided to retain the risks of cost overruns and delays rather than pay worleyparsons to bear them a new york judge sided with worleyparsons request for an international arbitration panel last july worleyparsons said the arbitration hasnt begun yet exxon declined to comment on the overall cost of the project the company said in court filings it paid worleyparsons more than 550 million and claims it is owed a refund for work the contractor did to fix mistakes worleyparsons says it is owed 20 million more fran van reyk a spokeswoman for worleyparsons said the dispute is limited to the russian mega project and hasnt affected its other work for exxon delays and cost overruns in recent years have heightened tensions between companies like exxon and the contractors they hire to design and build massive energy installations but experts say it has been uncommon for big oil companies and their engineering contractors which work together around the world to sue each other its very unusual to actually have a dispute go all the way to litigation said edward merrow president of independent project analysis inc which consults for energy companies that operate big projects mr merrow declined to comment on specific projects but said that the industry in general is ailing from a shortage of experienced energy hands even as companies pursue hardertoreach oil deposits i think well see more litigation in part because were going to see more important glaring engineering errors he said the stumbles at arkutundagi are relatively mild compared with other projects such as a venture in kazakhstans caspian sea that is more than 30 billion over budget and has yet to cough up oil in meaningful amounts but even a yearlong delay can have a significant impact on the profitability of a big project when exxon announced the startup of arkutundagi in january oil sold for about 50 a barrel a year ago when the project was originally supposed to start pumping crude a barrel of oil fetched more than twice as much the arkutundagi oil field lies beneath the shallow icechoked waters about 15 miles from the shores of sakhalin island in russias far east to tap it exxon ordered up a platform weighing more than 200000 tons four cylindrical legs anchor into the seabed and rise above the waters surface supporting a series of decks that house a drilling rig and crew quarters worleyparsons job was to design the top of the platform worleyparsons which brought in more than 7 billion in revenue last year has worked for exxon around the globe from alaskas north slope to papua new guinea after the firm started designing the platform top for arkutundagi exxon hired it in august 2010 to do a similar job for another offshore project a 14 billion venture in canada to tap oil off the coast of newfoundland called hebron soon after exxon began complaining to worleyparsons of delays budget increases and staff turnover on the arkutundagi work after promising to use its a team and all necessary resources when pursuing the project worleyparsons staffed the project with its c team and used substandard resources exxon alleges worleyparsons denies this saying the project took longer largely because exxon increased the scope of work required from the beginning exxon took a handson approach the contract says including reviewing the resumes and interviewing every worleyparsons employee working on arkutundagi exxon even installed 100 of its own workers in the houston offices of worleyparsons affiliates often sitting a few feet away from the contractors they managed while worleyparsons contract required it to fix errors at no cost the firm claims exxon never notified it of deficiencies as evidence of its good performance the contractor cites exxons award to design a platform for the hebron project adding that the company specifically requested some of the same personnel that worked on arkutundagi exxon expects to start pumping oil from its hebron project in 2017 write to daniel gilbert

american express to launch loyalty program with macys exxon at liberals claim to be outraged that chris christie settled a decadelong environmental lawsuit against exxon mobil for what they say is pennies on the dollar the real scandal is that the governor has exploited a dubious prosecution to backfill the new jersey budget last week the christie administration announced a 225 million settlement with exxon over 89 billion in claims for naturalresource damage at the sites of its former refineries in bayonne and bayway democrats claim mr christie struck a corrupt bargain that shortchanged the state but the truth is that the governor reaped more than the state deserved or a court likely would have awarded the bayonne and bayway sites which were once wetlands have accumulated chemical discharges dating to before exxons predecessor standard oil the state was then giving away its wetland for development fast forward a century in 1991 exxon entered into a consent order with the state to clean up the sites which are now owned by phillips 66 and internationalmatex tank terminals imtt in return the state agreed not to pursue more claims for historic damages a promise that appears to have been as good as the word of any jersey politician in 2002 the state began a blunderbuss legal campaign to retroactively dun businesses for loss of use damages under the states 1976 spill compensation and control act the goal was to coerce businesses into financing environmental projects as reparations for depriving the public of their usenever mind that the state had ages ago privatized many of these public resources to make their jobs easier democrats farmed out the legal work to private firms whose attorney fees and consultants are paid by the state and get a cut of the recoveries in 2004 exxon was slapped with a lawsuit but didnt roll over like its peers including chevron 1 million settlement and dupont 18 million in 2005 imtt paid 3 million to fund water quality improvements in bayonne the state tried to browbeat exxon into a settlement by charging 25 billion for the costs of restoring bayonne and bayway to a preindustrial state that had never existed the department of environmental protections quarterbaked restoration plan involved transforming historic intertidal wetlands into palustrine meadows it also removed critical flood protection since the sites could never be returned to eden the state charged exxon 64 billionan arbitrary figure calculated by a consultantto compensate the public for loss of use to resources that the public never had these funds would purportedly go to replace 33320 acres of natural habitat around the state the states case became even more dubious last year when mr christie signed a budget channeling all recoveries over 50 million from naturalresource lawsuits into the general fund in other words the state was shaking down exxon for 89 billion to pay for publicworker pensions even new jerseys liberal judges might balk at that fleecing mr christies 225 million deal with exxon still represents the biggest environmental settlement in state history liberals are upset that a mere 50 million will fund environmental projects some 45 million will cover legal costs and the rest will shore up pensions mr christie is merely distributing the spoils according to the priorities of his uniondominated state

this spring the latest move by the credit card company to appeal to a wider customer base the program called plenti will operate similar to drugstorerewards programs allowing customers to earn points by making purchases at the seven participating companies which also include at t inc rite aid corp and hulu the idea is that users can use points they earn by paying their at t wireless bill to pay for their purchases at rite aid amex which issues credit and charge cards and owns a processing network will operate the program collecting fees from the partner companies the announcement comes as amex prepares for the end  of its 16year relationship with costco wholesale corp after the two couldnt agree on terms the unusual partnership in which costco exclusively accepted amex cards had driven a significant chunk of business to the new york card company once seen as a status symbol for the affluent amex is under attack from competitors like jp morgan that are also going after wealthy americans amex is now trying to expand into other areas such as pitching prepaid cards  for lowend consumers but that strategy will likely take years to pay off amex also has branding agreements with companies such as delta air lines inc such partnerships called cobrands are established to build loyalty among specific types of customers cardholders often receive extra perks when they use cobranded cards while card companies and the merchant typically see higher levels of spending on those cards abeer bhatia chief executive of amexs us loyalty division said plenti is unique because it draws on a network of merchants that many us consumers shop at every day allowing users to build up points faster than they would for an airline or singlemerchant rewards program mr bhatia noted plenti users will be able to use any form of payment not just american express cards we want to be a much more welcoming brand said mr bhatia this helps us to do that mr bhatia said amex has put more than two years into developing the concept the company operates similar programs abroad in countries including poland germany and italy some of which have grown to include dozens of merchants the merchants participating in plenti are also hoping to get a sales bump from their participation macys for example has struggled with a tepid retail environment in recent quarters and is exploring new conceptssuch as a bargain version of its namesake department storesto expand its reach martine reardon macys marketing chief said she hopes plenti will help the retailer attract new demographics such as the millennial generation and create more loyalty among existing customers were trying to see where the american consumer is going said ms reardon exxon meanwhile is hoping to gain a competitive advantage by allowing customers to earn points filling up their gas tanks buying convenience items and washing their cars exxon executive michael gore said the company has seen a significant lift in sales after implementing similar loyalty programs abroad amex expects to launch the program around may while the company is also planning to introduce a cobranded card that would allow users to earn extra points in the future if all goes well mr bhatia said amex could see a halo effect from plenti that could drive consumers to its credit cards write to chelsey dulaney at chelseydulaneywsjcom 
nonus shales prove difficult to crack exxon shell and others are pulling back from oncepromising shale finds in europe asia after spending more than five years and billions of dollars trying to recreate the us shale boom   overseas some of the worlds biggest oil companies are starting to give up amid a worldwide collapse in crude prices   chevron corp exxon mobil corp and royal dutch shell plc have packed up nearly all of their hydraulic fracturing wildcatting in europe russia and china the reasons vary from sanctions in russia a ban in france a moratorium in germany and poor results in poland to crude prices below what it can cost to produce a barrel of shale oil chevron halted its last european fracking operations in february when it pulled out of romania shell said it is cutting worldwide shale spending by 30 in places including turkey ukraine and argentina exxon has pulled out of poland and hungary and its german fracking operations are on hold the result outside the us where fracking has produced a historic glut of oil only china argentina and canada have commercial shale production the us energy information administration says though america holds less than 10 of the worlds estimated shale reserves europe including russia and china alone have nearly triple the reserves of the us according to the eia the pace of development outside north america is slower everywhere than people thought it would be simon henry shells chief financial officer said in a recent interview a recovery in oil prices could change the equation giving big companies more room to take risky bets on shale   and bright spots for shale prospectors outside north america still exist regions of argentina and algeria appear to be as good as the us says faouzi aloulou an eia project manager who analyzes shale prospects two french companies and a british firm are planning to drill in the uk where there is a debate over the practices health and environmental effects in poland small companiesthe kind that pioneered the us shale boomare still drilling despite their big rivals discouraging results the publicity is bad but the reality is its going to be down to the smaller companies to prove the play as they did in the us says ois n fanning the executive chairman of san leon energy plc a uklisted explorer that announced a commercial gas discovery in poland in february and expects its first sales in early 2016 fracking works by using water sand and chemicals to fracture underground rock and hold the cracks open allowing oil and gas trapped in the rocks to flow unlike the longterm projects that the worlds biggest oil companies specialize in shale wells tend to have short lives and developing a shale field requires drilling many holes over a short period the technology worked well for small producers in north america but oil giants like exxon and shell with their thick layers of management and slow drillingapproval processes largely missed out on the profits there knowing other countries had shale the big companies last decade looked elsewhere to see if they could build a boom from scratch eastern european officials who were eager to wean their nations off russian gas welcomed the explorers chevron beginning late last decade invested in romania lithuania and poland which some geologists and oilbusinessdevelopment specialists said had europes most attractive shale potential in poland you had a mix of a higher resource estimate plus a government keen on promoting shale gas to reduce dependence on russian gas said richard sarsfieldhall of finnish consulting and engineering firm p but actual drilling results in poland were disappointing chevron kept drilling even after the eia in 2013 lowered its estimates of polands shalegas reserve by about 20 and other producers like frances total sa threw in the towel by 2014 chevrons eastern europe bet wasnt looking good it exited lithuania last summer last fall romanias president said the country didnt appear to have any shale resources then in january chevron said it had decided to leave poland shale gas opportunities across central and eastern europe do not compete with other opportunities within chevrons global portfolio a spokeswoman said the company is still evaluating shale gas exploration in south africa a spokesman said conocophillips is the only large oil company still working in poland exxon had similar letdowns in hungary which it left in 2009 and poland which it exited in 2012 exxons efforts in germany have been thwarted by a fracking moratorium and western sanctions over ukraine have kept it and other international oil companies from developing russian shale now an exxon spokesman says the companys only ongoing nonnorth america shale exploration is in argentina and colombia one problem the companies have faced is the high cost of shale drilling outside the us when oil prices are low exploration wells in new areas require experimentation and lack the economies of scale in a more developed area wells in poland and china can cost up to 25 million each while american wells on average cost about 5 million said melissa stark lead author of a 2014 shale report by accenture llp shell first discussed shale exploration with chinese officials in 2006 said people familiar with the matter at the time the anglodutch company was looking for shale resources around the world and struck deals in sweden turkey russia and ukraine the ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions derailed plans in russia and ukraine shell left sweden in 2011 after exploration was unsuccessful a shell spokeswoman said the company is analyzing the results of wells drilled with a partner in turkey and is waiting to hear from the south african government about proceeding with shale projects there in china shell found shale gas in 2011 but problematic geology infrastructure and local protests delayed progress company officials and documents say last fall shell decided to pull back efforts there ms stark of accenture said countries with strong national oil companies such as china argentina and saudi arabia were more likely to lead shale development outside the us they have a mandate to extract their countries resources government support and lots of money you need a player with deep pockets and who can be there for several years she said staterun companies are there for the long term so they can invest for the longterm write to justin scheck at  justinscheckwsjcom  and selina williams at selinawilliamswsjcom

texas orders two oil firms to prove well isnt causing earthquakes xto energy owned by exxon and enervest ordered to appear at hearing texas regulators have ordered a subsidiary of exxon mobil corp and another company to prove that their wells near fort worth arent causing earthquakes a study published this week by seismic researchers at southern methodist university in dallas connected two wastewater disposal wells operated by xto energy inc which is owned by exxon and enervest operating llc with a series of earthquakes in azle texas on friday the texas railroad commission which regulates the states oil and gas industry told officials at both companies that they need to appear at hearings scheduled for june to justify why their wells shouldnt be shut down azle 17 miles northwest of fort worth experienced a string of earthquakes between november 2013 and january 2014 that were most likely caused by high volumes of drilling wastewater injected deep into the ground as natural gas was pumped out the study said the railroad commission of texas said it is reviewing smus research the process of hydraulic fracturing in which water chemicals and sand are pumped into the ground under high pressure results in large volumes of wastewater leftover wastewater is often pumped back underground into socalled disposal wells which have been linked to earthquakes by several studies xto said it looked forward to discussing the issue with regulators and university researchers we follow a protocol a scientificbased protocol when we site our disposal wells said suann lundsberg a spokeswoman for the company enervest cast doubt on the smu study we have serious questions about some of the assumptions in the smu paper and we look forward to sharing these with the commission said ron whitmire a company spokesman critics of fracking have questioned whether the industrys practices are to blame for an increase in earthquake activity in states such as texas meantime new scientific findings released tuesday again linked earthquakes to the practice of injecting wastewater from oil and gas operations deep underground adding to a growing consensus among researchers that energy development is probably causing seismic activity in oklahoma texas and other parts of the us in october the texas railroad commission adopted regulations on wells used to dispose of drilling fluids under the rules enacted to protect against possible earthquakes caused by the wells a new disposal well cant be sited without an evaluation of data from the us geological survey about the earthquake history within a 100squaremiles around the proposed site the new rules also give regulators the power to modify suspend or end a disposal well permit if scientific data show that it is contributing to earthquake activity or is likely to do so the commission said those amended rules are one reason it is asking questions about the xto and enervest wells it is incumbent upon us to apply these rules where and when appropriate for the protection of public safety and our natural environment said christi craddick chair of the commission in light of smus study linking disposal well activity to earthquakes in 2013 it is important to assess this new information in relation to the continued operational safety of the wells the commission previously investigated whether these disposal wells near azle were contributing to earthquakes but didnt uncover evidence of a definitive connection write to erin ailworth at erinailworthwsjcom

exxon to face regulators questions over quakes texas is scrutinizing us energy producers on injection wells to dispose of wastewater from hydraulicfracturing operations texas regulators are scrutinizing some of the biggest us energy producers in the wake of several earthquakes that have rocked the dallasfort worth area this year an exxon mobil corp subsidiary and eog resources inc one of the biggest shaleoil and gas pumpers are facing questions about their use of injection wells to dispose of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations the states oilandgas regulator on wednesday begins a series of hearings in austin to assess some oil companies role in causing the temblors a growing body of scientific research from federal state and academic researchers suggests that disposal wells often used to get rid of the dirty water leftover from fracking and brine from oilandgas production may be linked to increased seismic activity some in the energy industry are trying to discount those studies the commissions seismologist craig pearson has also expressed doubts that fracking or wastewater disposal wells are to blame for a recent spate of quakes in north texas home to a naturalgas exploration area called the barnett shale but ryan lance chief executive of conocophillips which is one of the biggest american shale drillers concedes there is a link weve followed all the data and the evidence and it does appear that in some areas water disposal is creating seismic events mr lance said last month were trying to understand how widespread it is one of the latest studies to link oil company activity to the temblors comes from southern methodist university in dallas it connects a fracking wastewater disposal well operated by xto energy inc an exxon subsidiary and another disposal well owned by enervest operating co to a series of earthquakes near fort worth between november 2013 and january 2014 both are scheduled to appear before state regulators between june 10 and june 16 researchers at smu say these quakes near the fort worth suburb of azle were probably the result of subsurface pressure changes caused by wastewater injections that occurred at the same time drilling operations were causing large amounts of brine to flow up to the surface and out of wells those pressure changes appeared to activate a longdead fault line in the area said matt hornbach an associate professor of geophysics at smu whether more recent quakes around dallas were caused by injection wells remains in question i dont want to rush to judgment he said an enervest spokesman said the company supports regulators efforts to investigate a possible link but will defend its well operations its premature to reach the conclusion that smu reached that oil and gas activities are the most likely cause of these seismic events said spokesman ron whitmire the study doesnt support those conclusions xto follows a scientific protocol when siting wells and looks forward to discussing that with regulators said spokeswoman suann guthrie until a few years ago earthquakes in and around dallas and nearby fort worth were rare not so today so far this year 23 earthquakes with magnitudes of 25 or more have hit the denselypopulated urban area that is home to 65 million people according to data from the us geological survey one of the latest a 40 magnitude temblor near venus 30 miles south of dallas prompted regulators to request that four energy companies that operate five nearby wastewater disposal wells shut them down and run tests three of the foureog bosque disposal systems llc and metro saltwater disposal incdidnt comment pinnergy ltd which operates one of the wells that was shut said it hired a thirdparty firm to run tests we at pinnergy are doing everything we can to support the efforts of the commission said chief executive randy taylor the heightened scrutiny comes six months after state regulator the railroad commission of texas changed well permitting rules so it can modify suspend or end disposal well approval if scientific data shows the well is contributing to earthquakes or is likely to do so the state also put a new requirement in place so that no new disposal well can be built without first evaluating historical us geological survey data for a 100squaremile area around the proposed site questions about the energy industrys role in inciting quakes prompted the changes and christi craddick chairwoman of the commission said she hopes the new rules will help provide answers weve had a lot of conclusions come to without a lot of facts supporting them she said when the data comes in our staff will look at that and give some recommendations meanwhile dallas mayor mike rawlings has said the city may have to revise building codes to deal with the issue and insurance agents are reporting a sudden interest in homeowner policies that cover earthquake damage gregory garretts home is just a couple blocks from the epicenter of one of the larger quakes that has struck a dallas suburb im not blaming anyone as far as the oil and gas industry but its nerveracking when the whole house shakes he told city council earlier this year it was very

from internal problems outward polls indicate that mr maduros ruling united socialist party is likely to suffer a major setback in national assembly elections set for dec 6   with venezuelans punishing the countrys leadership for an economic crisis marked by tripledigit inflation and chronic shortages of basic goods such as milk and detergent its primarily a distraction said risa graistargow an analyst at the risk consultancy eurasia group she added that mr maduro could be using the issue as leverage to pressure the new government in guyana i hope he will be conciliatory mr granger said in anticipation of his counterparts address this issue was settled 116 years ago mr granger said he personally told exxon officials in guyana in a meeting in recent days that they have nothing to worry about the difference is that exxon is us property and any attempt to physically interfere with us property might be faced with a different response mr granger said exxon declined to comment exxon has had strained relations with caracas after the country nationalized the companys heavyoil projects in 2007 for which venezuela has to pay the us oil major 16 billion   an arbitration court ruled earlier this year exxon and venezuelas state energy company ended their decadeslong relationship last week afterselling their joint ownership of a refinery   guyana which the world bank ranks as the western hemispheres thirdpoorest country in terms of per capita gross national product is trying to boost its coffers and find a share of oil off of northeastern south america after other neighbors such as suriname and brazil in recent years made significant discoveries mr granger said oil would be a boon for the country which relies on limited lumber gold and diamond mining and is grappling with high levels of youth unemployment a world health organization study in 2012 found guyana to have the highest suicide rate in the world four times the global average mr granger who is afroguyanese led a multiethnic coalition of political parties to victory after 23 years of a government controlled by guyanese of east indian descent he says his administration can offer stability and is looking for new investors the prospect for oil has also attracted spanish energy company repsol sa which according to guyanas government requested a sixmonth extension this week on its offshore exploration license venezuelas objections have grown louder with exxons presence mr granger said i cant think of any other reason for the tensions there was no other precedent except for the presence of exxon despite the territory controversy guyana and venezuela have strengthened economic ties since signing an oilforrice deal in 2009 thanks to the agreement guyana has become the largest supplier of the grain to 29 million venezuelans who take in nearly half of guyanas rice exports in exchange for refined oil that deal is set to expire later this year and mr granger says his foreign minister is scheduled to be in venezuela on monday with the hopes of renewing the supply contract and securing a crucial market for guyanese farmers i dont think there will be any danger that the border matter will jeopardize the agreement mr granger said write to kejal vyas at  kejalvyaswsjcom

falling crude prices upend canadas oil sands projects royal dutch shell exxon mobil and imperial oil rely on deeply buried oil sands deposits to increase cash flows two years ago canadian oil sands producer cenovus energy inc buoyed by success at its flagship project and eager to cut operating expenses halved the amount of instrumentation used to measure finicky temperature and pressure at its wells but that turned out to be a costly mistake that cut into its foster creek sites production volumes which only have recently recovered after the company reversed course we started to cut our operating costs but in hindsight thats a lesson learned harbir chhina cenovus executive vice president in charge of oil sands said in an interview if i compare the oil sands to a baseball game i think we just finished the first inning he said of the roughly two million barrels a day that canada currently produces from its oil sands about half is mined from the surface using giant excavators and the worlds tallest dump trucks the rest is too deep to mine and must be recovered by newer technology such as injecting steam underground to leach out oil deposits that accounts for about 80 of canadas reservesthe worlds thirdlargest source of untapped crude the global downturn in oil prices is shining a harsh light on the high cost of extracting canadas oil sands which are the biggest single source of us crude imports some of the worlds biggest oil companies including royal dutch shell plc and exxon mobil corps canadian unit imperial oil ltd are counting on those deeply buried oil sands deposits to increase cash flows and shore up their global production levels chronic cost overruns amid the pressure of lower oil prices are calling into question how much of those reserves can be recovered profitably the most common technique for extracting the deepest deposits involves drilling a pair of horizontal tunnels that bracket an underground oil formation from above and below steam pumped into the top chamber melts solidified oil which gradually drips into the lower well where it is collected and pumped to the surface in industry circles it is known sagd or steam assisted gravity drainage and has no relation to hydraulic fracturing which uses a single well and highpressure injections of unheated water to release oil from shale formations but this method is turning out to be more technologically complex and unpredictable than billed when first deployed commercially in the early 2000s the key unforeseen challenge with the technology has been the lack in uniformity in reservoirs of heavy crude or bitumen in ancient river beds that now lie buried under the boreal forests in canadas western alberta province operators are having to drill more wells pump more steam underground and lay more pipe above ground to meet targets thanks to varying thickness impermeable rock formations and high watersaturation levels the result is a lot of trial and error as kinks are worked out the technology isnt onesizefitsall said reynold tetzlaff pricewaterhousecoopers canada energy team leader noting that the continuing capital requirements necessitate strong balance sheets its getting harder and harder for smaller companies to make a go of sagd many of their projects were greenlighted when prices were higher or believed to be heading higher but what was tolerable a year ago at 100 a barrel has become less profitableor unworkablein todays world of 50 a barrel crude the breakeven point for a brandnew sagd project including a 9 average return on investment requires crude prices of at least 65 a barrel which is among the highest extraction cost in the oil industry according to the bank of nova scotia on wednesday us oil prices dipped below 50 a barrel   after weekly data showed an unexpected increase in ussupplies several oncepromising canadian junior oilsands producers that bet on this form of extraction have suspended operations and sought protection from creditors including connacher oil gas ltd ivanhoe energy inc laricina energy ltd and southern pacific resource corp most oilsands startups and a few large producerssuch as cenovusrely entirely on sagd and most of the oil sands multinational players also use it for some of their current output or are counting on it for their future production plans cenovus canadian natural resources ltd suncor energy inc and shell all announced plans earlier this year to shelvebut not abandonplans for new or expanded subsurface oil sands projects until global oil prices rebound or costs can be reduced dramatically even before the tumble in oil prices frances total sa and statoil asa of norway indefinitely postponed a pair of underground oil sands projects last year citing cost issues sagd was developed conceptually in the late 1960s and tested in the 1970s by exxons imperial unit while it has licensed the technology broadly since then to rivals the company has yet to deploy it beyond the test phase rich kruger the chief executive of imperial said the technology holds promise but that other more shovelready extraction methods have taken priority its more about technical readiness mr kruger said weve invested a lot of time and energy in sagd and are very confident in it but we look to optimize it to get the most of it he said even some of the richest deposits have proved more difficult to develop than envisioned requiring more steam per barrel to separate hockey puckhard heavy oil embedded in sand suncors biggest sagd project known as firebag uses 40 more steam per barrel than it was initially designed for despite a decade of operation according to a recent report by calgary investment bank peters we believe that most companies in the oil sands are drilling significantly more wells than initially planned to keep production rates stable a recent peters report said cenovus talked boldly this time last year of introducing mass manufacturing to canadas remote oil patch by ramping up installation of 30000 to 50000 barreladay wellsite modules but after the crude price slump the company slashed its 2015 spending budget deferred new sagd expansion phases and in late may ushered out half its executive leadership including the coo the calgarybased oil sands major says the personnel changes were long in the works and that it views the deferments as temporary cenovus executive mr chhina notes foster creek the industrys first largescale sagd project recouped its multibilliondollar construction cost within a decade of starting up in 2001 and is among the most efficient production sites sagd is a proven technology but it definitely still needs to be tweaked here and there he said write to chester dawson at  chesterdawsonwsjcom 
chevron and exxon get the plaudits but some smaller drillers faring well choice us oilandgas fields helping some firms weather oil price plummet giant oil companies are weathering the oil slump better than the average shale driller but even their famous stability is at times being surpassed by much smaller companies that own some of the choicest us oilandgas fields take cimarex energy co which drills in texas and oklahoma the oil producers stock price has fared better than that of chevron corp the second largest american oil company by revenue since crudeoil prices started crashing last june shares of diamondback energy inc an eightyearold oil producer with a 43 billion market value have held up almost as well as exxon mobil corps over that stretch and as of this week cabot oil gas corp a houstonbased shalegas specialist had bested all the big oil companies in stockmarket performance since last summer when the price of crude first began to crash diamondback cabot and cimarex tend to carry less debt than their peers and can coax fuel out of the ground at a lower cost it is a combination that has proved at least as attractive as the deep pockets of the worlds biggest oil companies over the last year as us crude prices plunged by more than 50 to less than 50 a barrel the three shale specialists have seen their shares fall between 20 and 30 since by contrast an index of 21 us energy companies almost all of them oilandgas producers has declined 523 over the same period there have been a handful that have bucked the trend chad mabry an analyst at mlv co said of the bestperforming shale drillers it isnt clear how long the stars of us shale drilling can rival the industrys heavyweights these giant oil companies like exxon and chevron which report quarterly profits on friday are helped by enormous cash flows and easy access to credit the shareprice buoyancy of elite shale drillers including eqt corp concho resources inc and eog resources inc could be a sign that investors are betting on a rebound in oil and gas prices or it might reflect a bet that some of the smaller most efficient players will be bought at a premium by the big oil companies said doug terreson head of energy research at evercore isi as the oil behemoths report earnings this week analysts expect the companies to cushion the blow of cheap crude by reaping higher profit margins from refining it into gasoline and diesel such builtin hedges combined with hefty dividends have helped the biggest energy companies stem falling share prices better than most small and midsize us drillers like apache corp marathon oil corp and hess corp yet even exxon chevron and royal dutch shell plc are grappling with how to improve profits when tapping new sources of oil and gas has become increasingly expensive the three biggest western oil firms are all running a cashflow deficit as a result of heavy capital spending and dividend payments chevron has said it isnt likely to plug the gap until 2017 an exxon spokesman referred to comments made by its chief executive earlier this year saying the companys business model gives it a competitive advantage chevron and shell declined to comment wood mackenzie an energy consultancy estimates that big energy companies have delayed spending about 200 billion on bigticket oilandgas developments since prices began to fall last year if the delays continue they may struggle to boost their output and cash flow you can legitimately question the growth potential for pretty much every one of the big oil companies said guy baber head of integrated company research at simmons co international by contrast investors have flocked to shale drillers that operate with the greatest efficiency and promise to increase output diamondback focuses on the permian basin a vast oilproducing region in west texas and touts its fast drilling and ability to make money at oil prices as low as 30 a barrel it booked a 64 million profit on 1014

its always exxons fault why climate warriors keep returning to the same whipping boy in 2009 the new york times was forced to issue a 328word correction a retraction in all but name because a reporter assailing an industry group could not distinguish the proposition the greenhouse effect exists from the proposition any and all environmentalist proposals for dealing with a possible human influence on the greenhouse effect must be met uncritically here we go again in the form of an expos of exxon by the website insideclimatenewsorg echoed by the los angeles times and other media organs see if you can follow the logic exhibited in the icn series because exxon concerned itself with how a warming arctic might affect the safety of its pipelines and drilling structures there exxon is a hypocrite on climate change because exxon refrained from developing an indonesian gas field that would have meant releasing or capturing a large amount of associated carbon dioxide exxon is a hypocrite on climate change exxon in the early 1980s adapted thenexisting climate models to estimate that a doubling of atmospheric carbon would lead to a temperature increase of 15 to 45 degrees celsius then as now the company also judged such models not reliable enough to serve as the basis for large and costly policy actions so exxon is a hypocrite heres the interesting part these studies took place 35 years ago in completely unrelated comments nobodys idea of a denier harvards martin weitzman coauthor of the book climate shock recently complained about the lack of climate modeling progress in 35 years he cited the un climate panels latest temperature forecast which is identical ie unimproved in precision to exxons three decades earlier through six installments icn kept promising the goods on how exxons public advocacy conflicted with its private understanding of climate change the series essentially delivered nothing an exxon spokesman is quoted as saying the risk of climate change is real and warrants action exxons ceo in the 1990s lee raymond the villain of the series is quoted as saying many people believe that global warming is a rocksolid certainty but its not the companys position on a carbon tax is that    it should be revenue neutral the real smoking gun isnt the exxon revelations but the climate communitys hysterical reaction to them veteran campaigner bill mckibben and democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders demand the obama administration launch a criminal investigation a washington monthly writer in a blog post for the psychiatric textbooks delivers himself of this remarkable paragraph exxonmobils deceit continues to this very day the company still insists that it supports federal revenueneutral carbon tax legislation how can we possibly take their word for it after the company spent years attacking the abundant scientific evidence pointing to the critical need for such legislation just spend a minute parsing that one icn calls its exxon series the road not taken were its reporters really the free thinkers they imagine themselves to be however they would put aside such crass exercises in orthodoxy enforcement they would investigate exactly when and how the climate movement itself made its illadvised turn toward frantic exaggeration false certainty and vilification of anybody who raises scientific caveats theyre right exxon was once a respected participant in the debate it wasnt exxon that equated its opponents to holocaust deniers the 16 million that exxon spent between 1998 and 2005 to support organizations that pointed out the inadequacies of climate models would have bought less than 1 of the media attention al gore was getting at the time talk about a road not taken a calmer discussion based on uncertainties risks and benefits might long ago have allowed the introduction of a modest carbon tax in the only way it would be politically salableby using the proceeds to reduce taxes on investment and work washington might have set itself a clear if modest agenda to fund basic battery research rather than squander taxpayer dollars on tesla and solyndra all this might have been belowthefold insidethepaper news rather than turning climate science into another polarizing proxy for irreconcilable leftright partisan differences on economics but the truth is people like mr mckibben cant afford practical meaningful progressbecause it would be unnoticeable and undramatic modest tweaks to incentives then seeing how energy technology and the energy economy adapted over time would not fulfill their need for a pressing global crisis that casts them as moral warriors wellfunded ones whose victory over deniers and climate criminals is always just around the cornerand must remain so in order to keep the money media attention and political fealty flowing

exxon donated its corporate papers to the university of texas for public viewing 360 link to full text full text over the past few weeks a tempest has been swirling around one of americas most successful companies with claims that the company found ignored and then hid evidence that human activity causes climate change conjectures about exxon mobil make good headlines but the facts are more important and here they are exxon has always been transparent about its climatechange research and has shared that research with the scientific community from the beginning in fact exxon donated its corporate papers to the university of texas for public viewing this is a model of transparency further exxon has consistently stated the risks of climate change and has long supported a carbon tax as the most effective and transparent way for government to reduce carbon emissions for this exxon has been criticized by some who deny the effects of climate change the company also has helped lead the development of cleanenergy technology its partnerships with the nations premier research institutions including stanford and mit for researching energy efficiency and future technologies have been widely acclaimed exxon scientists helped develop the lithium ion battery an important component of the electric car the company is investing more than 500 million into research on next generation biofuels from sources such as algae we must address climate change but attacking companies that are creating jobs growing the economy and providing valuable research isnt progress policy makers should recognize that private companies have played and will continue to play a vital role in developing the cleanenergy technologies that help achieve greater energy efficiency and improve our lives during a 2012 speech in oklahoma president obama said if were going to end our dependence on foreign oil if were going to bring gas prices down once and for all as opposed to just playing politics with it

amid weak oil prices pemex touts its rockbottom production costs petrleos mexicanos says its costs are less than exxon mobil chevron bp and brazils petrobras mexico citywith oil prices sinking to levels not seen in more than a decade mexican national oil company petr leos mexicanos said tuesday that its production costs are among the lowest in the world averaging under 10 per barrel among currently producing fields and less than 7 a barrel for its cheapest fields furthermore pemex said its production costs are actually falling because of the recent devaluation of the peso since oil is sold in dollars and service contracts and other costs are paid in pesos this cost level means that pemex production activities continue to be profitable even with the recent fall in hydrocarbon prices the company said in a statement us oil prices were about 30 a barrel  on tuesday while pemex said that the average price for its basket of mostly heavy export oils was 2150 a barrel pemex said that its production costs were lower than counterparts like exxon mobil chevron bp and brazils petrobras citing company reports filed with the us securities and exchange commission pemex said that media reports putting its costperbarrel at 23 had included a series of future costs in that calculation such as exploration drilling new infrastructure and production in new fields those costs are likely to be reduced in the current price climate the company said since service providers must lower their prices to pemex to keep their contracts mexicos twoyearold oil reform opening up the sector to private and foreign companies for the first time in eight decades also allows pemex to open new lines of business across the value chain that will benefit the bottom line the company said pemex reported an aftertax loss of 95 billion in the thirdquarter of last year and is shaving billions of dollars from its yearly budgets on orders from the federal government the companys oil production has also fallen every year since 2004 with no recovery in sight and it needs to borrow billions of dollar a year in order to pay its tax bill and make needed investments a key reason that legislators approved the controversial 2013 constitutional amendment allowing foreign participation in the oil sector was because of pemexs inability to develop more complicated oil fields in deep waters offshore and in nonconventional resources the government needs oil production to stay relatively high in order to meet its budget needs write to laurence iliff at laurenceiliffwsjcom 
church of england and new york state fund to press exxon on climate change potential carbon taxes could affect viability of longterm investment plans new yorks state pension fund and the church of england both investors in exxon mobil corp plan to file a shareholder resolution demanding the largest us oil company assess the impact on its business of climate change policy the shareholder resolution would require exxon to conduct an assessment of how its business would fare in the event governments take various actions to limit global warming government attempts to tax or put a price on carbon for example could affect the viability of some of exxons longterm investment plans said edward mason head of responsible investing for the church of england which has a portfolio of about 10 billion 1444 billion the resolution is evidence of a growing trend in europe crossing the atlantic large european investment companies have become increasingly vocal about climate change business risks in the last year governments agreed to limit carbon emissions following un talks in paris and mark carney governor of the bank of england warned investors must start taking carbon emissions policy risks into account a lot of this is about capital allocation mr mason said to say no policy changes are going to happen is an absurdly risky bet the company should look at the possibility of governments around the world imposing a carbon tax said patrick doherty director of corporate governance at the new york pension fund it will help inform investors in helping us to determine where we should put our money a spokesman for exxon said the company wouldnt comment on the shareholder resolution but that it would be considered by the board the company already attaches a carbon price to its emissions as part of its financial modeling the new york state common retirement fund is the third largest us public pension plan and manages assets worth 1845 billion exxon is its second biggest single investment together the church new york state and several other cofilers of the resolution own shares worth over 1 billion the company is worth about 329 billion in total similar resolutions targeting bp plc and royal dutch shell which were filed by the church were endorsed by their boards and passed last year mr mason said he believes the church has a duty to push company management to spend more time considering risks associated with climate change the church excludes investment in some sectors such as gambling thermal coal and pornography but for oil producers it takes an activist approach instead its about stewardship of creation the planet and life he said write to juliet samuel at  julietsamuelwsjcom 
china slowdown stokes fears of peak oil demand exxon cuts china energy demand forecast to 2025 a bedrock belief among oil forecasters has been that chinas voracious appetite for fossil fuels would stoke global energy demand for decades to come that assumption now appears increasingly shaky a highly anticipated new energy demand projection from exxon mobil corp released monday revises down the companys expectations for china and a slew of data is emerging that points to the toll a weakened economy has taken on chinese energy demand which is among the most important factors in determining the price of crude oil exxon cut its forecast for annual energy demand growth in china by almost a tenth to 22 a year through 2025 over a decade the revision amounts to more than brazils current annual oil consumption exxon also predicts that chinas thirst for energy will peak by 2030 the company played down the change to its figures based on its previously held view that chinas working population is reaching its apex said bill colton vice president of corporate strategic planning countries sometimes have to go through transitions he said one thing about economics its never a straight line a study issued last week by consultancy esai energy said that the pace of chinese oil demand growth would slow down 60 between now and 2030 when compared with the previous 15year period if demand wont come from china who will step in to fill chinas shoes said erica downs a senior analyst for the eurasia group who focuses on the countrys energy sector chinese energy consumption rose just 09 last year according to government estimates as gross domestic product increased 69 the worst annual rate in a quarter century the unexpected shortterm drop casts a shadow over the prospect of an oil price rally this year us and global benchmark crude prices fell below 27 a barrel last week for the first time since 2003 the oil glut in the market today was initially spurred by technology breakthroughs that unlocked more fuel reserves from the ground but the oversupply is being prolonged and deepened by weakerthanexpected demand that confluence of factors has made this oil downturn particularly difficult to resolve if tepid chinese energy consumption continues it could raise profound questions about the future stability of oil and gas producers around the world analysts say future expectations of robust energy demand have always been about more than just china india asian tiger countries and other emerging economies with vast populations eager to move into the middle class were supposed to follow chinas lead economically and on the energy demand front onceprominent fears that the world would soon run out of oil have been upended by plentiful supplies unleashed in recent years now emerging concerns about peak demand are starting to percolate from 2000 to 2010 chinas rapid industrialization created soaring demand for oil to power an economy tied to manufacturing and exports over that decade china accounted for more than 40 of the growth in global demand for crude oil the seemingly insatiable need caught the market by surprise helping push oil prices to a record 147 a barrel in 2008 but since 2010 chinas energy demand growth has fallen far more precipitously than its increases in gdp in 2012 for instance chinas gdp rose at nearly double the rate of energy consumption growth in 2014 it was more than triple and last year chinas gdp grew six times faster than energy demand growth according to figures from china and the world bank some analysts believe the numbers reflect uncertainty around the accuracy of data coming out of china yet even accounting for the possibility that gdp data is inflated the decoupling of economic and energy growth suggests that chinas transformation simply may not require as much fossil fuels as many have predicted just as energy companies underestimated chinese demand in the first decade of this century they may be overestimating it now said anthony barone senior vice president for deals and restructuring at argo a chicagobased consulting firm their growth has slowed and the belief that they are going to be the top country providing stable longterm demand for energy is looking optimistic he said bp plcs 2015 energy outlook forecast 39 energy demand growth for china through 2020 more than four times higher than the actual increase seen in the countrys consumption last years forecast growth for china by the international energy agency was nearly double the actual demand figure predictions of a tremendous wave of energy growth from china india and other fastgrowing countries are based on a very real trend as those economies mature hundreds of millions of people will enter the middle class and use more energy driving cars or using air conditioning that is why exxon still believes that from 2014 to 2040 global energy demand will grow by 25 according to the companys energy outlook

efforts to reduce carbon emissions make its future less certain royal dutch shell plc chevron corp and others have pursued multibilliondollar projects that hinge on natural gas which emits less carbon

why exxon is the getrichslow oil play value hunters picking through the oilindustry rubble may do better with exxon mobil investors buying beatendown energy stocks have been repeatedly bitten by renewed vicious plunges in oil   a safer and possibly morerewarding approach is to put a tiger in their tank with exxon mobil value seekers might balk at how little exxon actually has been affected by the industry rout while dozens of energyrelated companies fetch under half or even a 10th of their peak 2014 values often due to fears of financial distress the integrated giant is off by less than a third on thursday when a quickly discredited russian news report of an emergency meeting of oil producers briefly sent crude surging exxon shares rallied by a little over 3 an index of pureplay exploration and production companies jumped 7 so buying exxon shares even if an investor timed the bottom in oil prices perfectly hardly would be a getrichquick move but investors shouldnt lose sight of the getrichslow nature of a company that seems to emerge from each industry washout a bit stronger since 1970 through four booms and four busts in petroleum prices 100 invested in exxon has turned into 33000 including dividends nearly four times the gain of the s p 500 part of that success has been due to exxons penchant for shoveling cash to shareholders rather than investing aggressively during booms so far this century it has paid out over 380 billion through buybacks and dividends enough to buy rivals bp chevron and total combined at todays values and have 30 billion left over those capital returns left less for investing   in its business true in 2014 exxon marked the 21st consecutive year in which it added more hydrocarbon reserves than it produced averaging a replacement ratio of 123 much of that growth has come through the checkbook though not the drill bit it has mostly done so when oil prices were near a trough such as its merger with mobil announced in 1999 and the acquisition of xto energy in 2009 with the industry in a rut again it is only natural to speculate that exxon will once again pull the trigger another reason is that its reserve base isnt as attractive as it seems of 25 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2014 less than nine billion is in liquids and nearly five billion is in highcost bitumen and synthetic crude   and highlighting that exxon isnt quite so prescient the xto deal added plenty of natural gas at a time when the fuel was cheap and continued to get cheaper raising the odds of a cash deal is that exxons preference for buybacks in recent years over dividends gives it some financial flexibility at its recent pace it has been paying out just 2 billion annually to repurchase its own shares down from nearly 13 billion in 2013 while its cash flows are much lower too exxon has the ability to write larger checks than anyone in the industry the main constraints are retaining its status as one of three us companies with a triplea credit rating and as a dividend aristocrat a group that has managed to boost payouts annually for at least a quarter century but those constraints also are attractions that have helped exxons share price hold up better than any other large integrated oil company globally and that has preserved the value of its stock as an acquisition currency targets discussed by analysts include eog resources anadarko petroleum and whiting petroleum down between 45 and 90 from peaks hit in 2014 this tiger may be preparing to pounce again investors can too write to spencer jakab at  spencerjakabwsjcom

exxons imperial oil seeks approval for new canadian oilsands project company says midzaghe project in alberta could eventually produce 50000 barrels daily calgary albertaexxon mobil corps canadian unit said friday it has applied for regulatory approval of an oilsands project that could start daily production of 50000 barrels early in the next decade the proposed project valued at 2 billion canadian dollars 15 billion appears to buck a broader industry trend in which many oilsands producers have canceled or postponed planned development of projects due to sliding crude prices and uncertainty about the impact of new environmental policies in canada imperial oil ltd in which exxon owns a controlling 696 stake said the new midzaghe project would use a new technology designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 and potentially double production levels in comparison with existing extraction methods the company remains undecided on whether it will proceed with construction even if the government approves the project the filing for regulatory approval is a preliminary step and no investment decision has been made said spokeswoman lisa schmidt that decision will be based on a number of factors including the outlook for commodity prices and how its ability to provide a return on capital compares with the potential of competing projects in the companys portfolio she said new oilsands well projects typically require benchmark west texas intermediate crude prices to trade above 65 a barrel to break even current prices below 40 a barrel have made it challenging to justify investment to develop projects in canadas oil sands imperial had previously said it planned to seek permission for the midzaghe in northeastern alberta from the provincial government in early 2016 and the company said last fall that it planned to use the promising new extraction technique at another proposed oil sands site called aspen a decision on construction of aspen is expected as soon as next year pending regulatory approval if it moves ahead it would be the first commercial use of the new technology imperial said pilot tests conducted by the company using a modified form of its steamassisted gravity drainage or sagd technology showed a nearly 30 increase in production of heavy crude leached out of underground oil sands wells the new technique involves adding a chemical solvent to improve the flow of oil to the surface and reduce the need for steam made with generators fired by natural gas rich kruger imperials chief executive told investors at a meeting in september that this innovation called sasagd could double the volume of output from at least seven proposed oil sands projects including aspen and midzaghe raising production while lowering greenhouse gas emissions may help imperial cope with new regulations and taxes designed to limit the industrys carbon footprint the government of alberta has raised its carbon tax on largescale emitters and vowed to impose a 100 million metricton cap on such emissions from oil sands production the industry currently emits 70 million metric tons of greenhouse gases a year and the canadian environmental ministry has projected that emissions from oilsands productions will hit 103 million metric tons annually as soon as 2020 write to chester dawson at chesterdawsonwsjcom

exxon gets approval to restart torrance refinery company to pay 5 million in penalties for violations related to 2015 explosion at california refinery regulators late saturday approved exxon mobil corps request to restart its refinery in torrance calif which has been largely shut since an explosion last year   that injured four people the south coast air quality management districts hearing board said exxon will have to pay 5 million in penalties for violations related to the explosion and likely excess pollution during the restart process exxon plans to sell the 155000barreladay refinery   in southern california to pbf energy inc for more than 500 million in a deal announced in september but pbf has said it wont complete the deal until exxon first demonstrates that the plant is in good working condition the 2015 explosion forced a shutdown of the exxon refinerys key unit that makes gasoline called the fluid catalytic cracking unit as a result the plant has been barely functional for the past year operating at less than 20 capacity exxon and the regulators had already agreed to a preliminary agreement for the restart earlier this week but the final deal had to be voted on saturday after a public hearing which lasted throughout the day as many residents stood up one after another to express concern and opposition to a refinery with a long rap sheet of safety and pollution issues the vote was taken some 12 hours after the hearing began saturday morning in an emailed statement exxon expressed its gratitude to regulators we agree with the decision of the south coast air quality management district hearing board and appreciate its hard work and guidance as we work to safely restart the torrance refinery a restart of the facility could mean drivers in southern california and throughout the state will eventually pay slightly less for gasoline because the refinery is an important part of the regions gasolinerefining network its closure for the past year has reduced supply and that has made the states pump prices which are already higher than most due to taxes and stricter antipollution requirements even higher california pays an average of 280 a gallon for gasoline compared with the national average of 206 according to pricetracking firm gasbuddy bringing the fccu back to full power could take several weeks and the process will likely require exxon to send more pollutants into the air than normal the approval order which allows exxon to release higher emissions of particulate matter for longer periods than normal is in effect until july 29 write to dan molinski at  danmolinskiwsjcom

calpers pushes exxon to outline potential effects of climatechange initiatives following global accord to limit earths warming shareholders ask for added disclosures from energy investments investors holding more than 5 billion in exxon mobil corp shares are urging the company to disclose how its business would be affected by the global push to slow warming atmospheric temperatures the california public employees retirement system is planning an effort to put its muscle behind climaterelated shareholder proposals for the first time the outreach campaign is expected to test the strength of climate activism among shareholders of the worlds largest publicly traded oil company whose stockmarket value was 34555 billion as of monday according to factset environmentally minded exxon investors have sought for decades to use the companys annual meeting set for next month as a bully pulpit usually with limited success this year a change in investor attitude following the december climate talks in paris and an active proxy campaign could garner far more votes than in previous contests analysts say similar proposals passed overwhelmingly last year after executives at royal dutch shell plc and bp plc decided to embrace them but climaterelated resolutions have never exceeded 35 in votes at the annual meetings of exxon or chevron corp this isnt an environmental issue this has moved into the mainstream following the paris agreement said anne simpson calpers investment director of global governance nearly 200 countries pledged in paris in december to hold the rise in average global temperatures to less than two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels calpers is launching a campaign to encourage shareholders to support proposals urging exxon chevron and 10 other energy and mining companies to examine how much of their reserves would have to be left untapped if the twodegree goal were to be achieved ms simpson said exxon and chevron executives have had a consistent message for years on the future of oil and gas drilling saying that economic growth in emerging economies such as india and china will power fossilfuel demand for many decades the companies as well as forecasters including the international energy agency dont yet consider the lowcarbon scenario contemplated in the paris agreement to be a base case or most likely outcome last week chevron recommended a vote against the proposal the company said it already accounts for climate risks in its project planning and that such a disclosure would put it at a competitive disadvantage both exxon and chevron sought to keep the twodegree proposals from reaching their proxy ballot telling the us securities and exchange commission they are vague and unnecessary given their other disclosures about climate risks last month the sec ruled the proposals could go forward the resolutions are nonbinding more than 30 investors including new york citys pension funds and legal general investment management have committed to supporting the exxon resolution according to ceres a non profit that advocates for sustainable business the campaign is part of a nascent movement advocating for greater understanding of climate risks the central idea is that to achieve the twodegrees celsius goal a significant amount of oil gas and coal held by world producers would have to remain in the ground barclays plc estimates that in a twodegree scenario energy producers would earn 103 trillion in revenue between 2014 and 2040 34 trillion lower than in a basecase scenario for energy consumption some experts say these concerns are overblown companies are valued on their expected production in the next 10 to 15 years not on their entire portfolio of reserves said nancy meyer associate director for climate strategy at consulting firm ihs the whole premise that companies are financially risky today because their nonproved assets may be unburneddoesnt necessarily align with how those assets are valued in the marketplace ms meyer said todays low energy prices are a bigger risk to producers than potential future regulations she said bank of england governor mark carney made speeches in 2014 and 2015 warning that climate change poses risks to investors and insurers the g20 group of industrial nations asked the financial stability board in basel switzerland to examine the issue one problem is that there is little consensus on how investors should quantify carbon risks around 400 sets of guidelines exist for disclosures related to climate or sustainability according to a report released march 31 by a financial stability board task force chaired by former new york city mayor michael bloomberg the first step is just about getting enough information from companies so that we can make decisions that are grounded in economics said jessica ground global head of stewardship at schroders which manages 462 billion in assets and is supporting the climate disclosure resolutions write to

exxon fires back at climatechange probe argues subpoena represents unwarranted fishing expedition into its records that violates its constitutional rights exxon mobil corp went to court wednesday to challenge a government investigation of whether the company conspired to cover up its understanding of climate change a sign the energy company is gearing up for a drawnout legal battle with environmentalists and officials on the politically charged issue the company filed court papers in texas seeking to block a subpoena issued in march by the attorney general of the us virgin islands one of several government officials pursuing exxon wednesdays filing argues that the subpoena is an unwarranted fishing expedition into exxons internal records that violates its constitutional rights the chilling effect of this inquiry which discriminates based on viewpoint to target one side of an ongoing policy debate strikes at protected speech at the core of the first amendment the filing says exxon also dismisses the notion that there is any suggestion of a crime saying attorney general claude earl walker issued the subpoena without the reasonable suspicion required by law and based on an ulterior motive to silence those who express views on climate change with which they disagree a request for comment to the us virgin islands attorney generals office wasnt immediately returned  calpers pushes exxon to outline potential effects of climatechange initiatives   april 12  think tank calls subpoena an affront to first amendment rights   april 8  church of england and new york state fund to press exxon on climate change   jan 15  carbontax debate brings together unusual allies   nov 30  exxon gets subpoena from ny regarding climatechange research   nov 5 in the subpoena the us virgin islands told exxon it could be violating two state laws by purportedly obtaining money under false pretenses and conspiring to do so both sides see this as a pivotal moment in a growing campaign by environmentalists to deploy a legal strategy used against tobacco companies in the 1990s by arguing that oil companies have long hidden what they know about climate change tobacco firms finances and credibility were badly damaged by lawsuits accusing them of hiding the truth about their products a key meeting in the new push unfolded in january behind closed doors at a manhattan office building the session brought together about a dozen people including kenny bruno a veteran of environmental campaigns and bill mckibben founder of 350org two activists who helped lead the successful fight to block the keystone xl pipeline the new campaigns goals include to establish in publics mind that exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity and all creation toward climate chaos and grave harm according to an agenda of the meeting viewed by the wall street journal this new legal strategy stems in part from environmentalists frustration at what they see as the inadequacy of recent climate deals their hope is to encourage state attorneys general and the us justice department to launch investigations and lawsuits that ultimately will change exxons behavior force it to pay big damages and drive public attention to climate change its about helping the larger public understand the urgencies of finding climate solutions said lee wasserman director of the rockefeller family fund which hosted the january meeting its not really about exxon exxon and its supporters dismiss the comparison with tobacco cigarettes are a harmful addictive product used by a portion of the public they say while fossil fuels are fundamental to the world economy in wednesdays filing exxons lawyers say the company has confirmed for more than a decade that it sees the risks of climate change and that it has publicly advocated for a carbon tax as the best way to regulate carbon emissions a key part of the activists strategy is to seek documents that show otherwise that exxon despite knowing the dangers of climate change has sought to challenge the scientific consensus such revelations would help delegitimize exxon as a political actor the january agenda said in a twist the initiative is set to be bankrolled partly by the heirs of john d rockefeller the founder of exxons forebear standard oil the rockefeller family fund has signaled it will help fund the campaign through its existing backing of 350org though it hasnt provided a figure wednesdays filing is exxons first legal salvo in what could be a long war since at least four state attorneys general have launched investigations and a dozen others have signaled they might none has been as aggressive as new york attorney general eric schneiderman who subpoenaed exxon in november   seeking information about the companys research on climate change over several decades exxon hasnt challenged that subpoena partly because a new york law called the martin act gives mr schneiderman wide latitude to investigate businesses for possible fraud or misrepresentation the new legal theory has yet to gain momentum within the justice department according to officials familiar with internal discussions but after prodding by lawmakers the federal bureau of investigation is conducting a preliminary review the issue also has seeped into the political arena democratic presidential frontrunner hillary clinton has called for an investigation of exxon and sen sheldon whitehouse d ri pressed us attorney general loretta lynch on the matter at a recent congressional hearing the activists are focusing on internal exxon documents that have surfaced in news outletsincluding in publications or investigative projects that were funded partly by the rockefeller brothers fund and rockefeller family fund which favor strong climate action the media outlets involvedthe los angeles times and insideclimate newshave said the reporting was done without influence by the funding sources the activists biggest challenge may be to establish clear culpability for global warming millions of individuals contribute with their use of fossil fuels while national governments have done little despite knowing the risks said david uhlmann a university of michigan law professor and former federal environmental crimes prosecutor exxon should have been far more forthright about the risks associated with climate change but all of us are culpable for our collective failure to change mr uhlmann said the likelihood that these investigations will lead to significant damages are small but sharon eubanks who led the tobacco litigation during the clinton and bush administrations and attended the january meeting said she believes a lawsuit by the government against exxon is viable under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico allows the government to pursue civil lawsuits against a people or entities working in concert to violate the law write to amy harder at

big oil big mistake investors overpay for income at exxon share prices defy gravity despite big slump in quarterly results whats the big deal about big oil if a time traveler had shown fridays firstquarter results for exxon mobil and chevron to an investor a year ago that person would have had a tough time guessing their share prices today exxons results beat expectations   but it posted its worst quarterly earnings this century chevrons loss was its worst   in 15 years and this happened alongside record global inventories a recently failed production freeze   by major exporters a federal reserve in tightening mode and a slowdown in emergingmarket economies so share price predictions for exxon and chevron would have been pretty grim but notheir stocks are doing fine and that may not have so much to do with the price of oil the attraction appears to be stability and extraordinarily consistent   exxon wins the beauty contest in that regard not only has it outperformed its peers by an average of nearly 14 percentage points over the past year in total shareholder return but it has edged out the s p 500 by over five points yes both companies have suffered debtrating downgrades and halted their onceprodigious stock buyback programs but both exxon and chevron remain dividend aristocratsthe 10 or so of companies in the s p 500 that have increased dividends annually for at least a quarter century their status as integrated companies provides a downstream cushion to the upstream carnage caused by low hydrocarbon prices but not enough both companies had to pay out more than their free cash flow last quarter despite big reductions in capital spending it is time for a reality check if investors think the stillglum consensus outlook on oil and naturalgas prices is wrong then they should bet instead on pure exploration and production companies those would benefit far more from higher prices but if investors want safety and income in the seventh year of lilliputian bond yields they seem to be overpaying both exxon and chevron now command nearly their highest multiple of projected enterprise value to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization since the spring of 2000 several relatively dowdy companies look pricey on that basis too with supermarket chain kroger cerealmaker kellogg householdgoods maker colgatepalmolive fastfood chain mcdonalds and pharmaceutical giant pfizer fetching a 30 premium on average to their multiples from 2010 through 2015 safety is a poorly understood term just because the odds of a dividend cut are remote it doesnt mean a companys share price isnt vulnerable paying up for big oil in what could still be a prolonged industry slump could end up being downright dangerous write to spencer jakab at  spencerjakabwsjcom 
business news exxon swoons but investors cheer  us oil giant is latest to post dismal results but shareholders see hope as prices rise exxon mobil corp reported its smallest quarterly profit since 1999 on friday the latest in a parade of woeful earnings out of oil and gas producers this year as a supply glut dragged down prices and ate into income despite the companys 63 drop in profit investors shrugged off the weak performance and exxons shares rose less than 1 to 8840 that mirrored a trend of generally higher oil and gas stocks after firstquarter earnings as crude prices this

statoil asa said they were back in the black last quarter after suffering losses in the final three months of 2015 the improved results reflect aggressive cuts in spending in plans for drilling and employment that companies made to cope with a nearly twoyear slump in crude prices along with a surge in oil prices which have risen more than 70 from a february low the results have helped fuel a 9

a climate courtroom crusade scorches due process attorneys general demand exxons files without first asking a judgea case of the fox guarding the hens six months ago new york attorney general eric schneiderman issued a subpoena demanding that exxon mobil turn over records concerning its research on climate change in march mr schneiderman took the predictable next step announcing that a coalition of attorneys general will hold fossil fuel companies accountable the first amendment ladies and gentlemen does not give you the right to commit fraud he said the threat to scientific inquiry and political speech is obvious not so widely recognized is the underlying violation of due process start with the fact that mr schneiderman and the other attorneys general have relied as their opening move on a nonjudicial subpoena to force the disclosure of information traditionally federal and state governments could demand testimony papers or other information in only very limited ways a legislative committee could call witnesses and insist that they appear and testify but an attorney general who wanted to rifle through a private companys filing cabinet had to get a warrant signed by a judge based on probable cause or had to ask a court overseeing a grand jury to issue a subpoena otherwise the attorney general had to wait until he brought civil or criminal charges and in a criminal case he could get only a very limited version of discovery as the founding generation knew from experience government demands for papers could be dangerous much has changed over the past century when civil discovery of evidence now a common process evolved in the late 19th and early 20th centuries some states for the sake of convenience allowed subpoenas for such purposes to be signed not by judges but by clerks and then even by parties in cases the subpoena power thus began to drift out of the hands of the judiciary although this initial step was trivial it offered legitimacy for what followed over the 20th century congress gave administrative agencies from the agriculture department to the department of health and human services statutory authority to issue subpoenas in their own name and state legislators have granted such power to their equivalent agencies all sorts of administrators at both levels of government thereby acquired an expansive power to demand information without initially working through a judge this was bad enough but it gets worse lawmakers also granted subpoena authority to their attorneys general new york did so in 1921 even prosecutors thus can now read through private papers on demand the supreme court upheld the subpoena power of agencies in united states v morton salt 1950 on the theory that administrators are exercising the power of a grand jury this is improbable but it is even more improbable for prosecutors who lead grand jury proceedings having a role in facilitating grand juries a prosecutor cannot by himself be assumed to act as one even if the morton salt argument really justifies administrative subpoenas it cannot explain an attorney generals subpoena nor can the dangers of giving a subpoena power to prosecutors be waved away in a grand jury a judge oversees the proceedings to prevent excessive intrusions into private papers and lives in a government agency the administrator typically is not an elected official and therefore is not using the subpoena power to generate public support for his own political campaign but when an attorney general issues a subpoena the opposite conditions prevail there is no ongoing judicial supervision and far too much politics regrettably this evasion of judicial subpoenas is only the beginning of the dueprocess problem for mr schneiderman and other attorneys general have the power to bring not simply administrative but criminal charges on the basis of the information they force out of private parties they thereby dangerously combine the roles of grand jury and prosecutor if mr schneiderman were bringing a civil case he could seek discovery only after filing a complaint about a concrete injury and his demands would be subject to judicial supervision including protective orders to narrow their scope if he were bringing a criminal case he would have difficulty getting much information at all from the defendant through discovery but with the usurped subpoena power he can engage in a roving investigation unlimited by any formal accusation and then can use the results to bring criminal charges this is a dangerous amalgam of grandjury and prosecutorial power in one person mr schneidermans subpoena to exxon mobil thus stands apart his ability to demand information in this way is a quintessential case of the fox guarding the henhouse the threats to privacy in our society are not merely technological they also are legal in addition to electronic surveillance nonjudicial subpoenas allow government to examine private documents as if they were an open book and as shown by mr schneiderman when attorneys general can issue such subpoenas a valuable judicial power becomes a prosecutorial threat to liberty and due process mr hamburger is a law professor at columbia university and the author of is administrative law unlawful university of chicago press 2014

exxon is big tobacco tell me another the corrupt medicaid deal propped up tobacco stocks and government revenue regarding philip hamburgers a climate courtroom crusade scorches due process   oped may 12 i find it curious that new york attorney general eric schneiderman can compel exxon mobil to turn over its data refuting global warming while lamar smith a sitting us congressman cannot compel the epa to reveal its data allegedly supporting global warming it would seem that the first step in proving fraud would be to demonstrate that exxon mobil is incorrect obviously if the epa had such data in its possession it would be providing it to whomever desired it and probably pressuring media outlets to publish it michael r cheuvront san antonio new york ag schneiderman is claiming exxon mobil

exxon mobil what they did to tobacco readers might want to take a look at tobacco stock prices yup all up strongly since the 1998 master settlement agreement that 46 states imposed on big tobacco ostensibly as punishment for its sins how was the industry expected to pay 246 billion in alleged medicaid damages by selling more cigarettes of course now helped by a governmentorchestrated pricing cartel with the profits equitably shared between the companies the pols and the buccaneers of the trial bar a decade later the american bar association journal would look back and conclude the only big winners in the litigation appear to be the tobacco companies the state treasurers and the lawyers who represented both sides so obviously corrupt was the outcome that it had one salutary effect it capped the careers of the ambitious state pols who promoted this travesty hubert humphrey iii possessor of minnesotas most illustrious name finished last in a threeman governors race texas ag dan morales went to jail for creating fake documents in an attempt to secure a slice of the states windfall for a lawschool buddy dickie scruggs most prominent of the antitobacco lawyers would later go to jail for bribing a judge one wonders if new york attorney general eric schneiderman and californias kamala harris who keep trumpeting the tobacco precedent while attacking exxon really have given their analogy the due diligence it deserves on the advice of their lawyers tobacco executives pretended not to know what their own warning labels said which became their main source of legal jeopardy in allegedly parallel fashion exxon is accused of knowing about the science of climate change and casting doubt on the science of climate change the problem is knowing and doubting are the same when it comes to the iffy claims of climate science at its current state of development rhode islands sheldon whitehouse in his latest unattended senate soliloquy demanding a federal rico investigation of exxon claims that real science continues to prove the connection between carbon pollution and the startling changes we see in our climate and oceans he certainly didnt get this from the latest report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change sharer of al gores nobel prize while insisting that climate models have improved steadily the group abandons its central forecast of three degrees celsius of warming from a doubling of atmospheric carbondioxide and offers no central forecast at all where it once said warming of less than 15 c would be very unlikely now it says warming of less than 1 c would be extremely unlikely with these adjustments even a politicized orthodoxyprone ipcc recognizes an emerging shakeup in climate science after 200 years of prolific coal burning after 30 years of increasingly rigorous temperature measurement data from the actual atmosphere no longer are being treated as an inconvenience by climate modelers now these realworld data are driving new estimates of climate sensitivityand lo these estimates suggest a net impact at the very low end of previous standard forecasts exxon never denied the risk of human influence on climate as even the expos s generated by compliant media cant help showing its real sin aside from consorting with researchers with a penchant for realism was criticizing policy proposals that would be enormously costly while having vanishingly small effect on atmospheric carbondioxide transportation fuels account for less than 15 of global emissions and exxons production accounts for just 4 of transportation fuels if the us government were looking for somebody to sue over climate changeor more to the point over climatechange hypocrisyit would do better to look in the mirror as a recent paper by the nonprofit national bureau of economic research put it coal mined on federally managed lands accounts for approximately 40 of us coal consumption and 13 of total us energyrelated co2 emissions he now criticizes the 1998 tobacco settlement but activist matt myers and his group tobaccofree kids walked away with a healthy share of the proceeds meanwhile the states quickly reneged on their own promise to spend the proceeds on antismoking programs and just this month a food and drug administration effort to shut down ecigarettes was quietly applauded by state treasurers and conventional cigarette companies as a step to uphold their revenue from the traditional tobacco products covered in the settlement as donald trump might say nobody ever went broke emphasizing the dishonesty and opportunism of the us political class including the activist class thats your most reliable forecast for how an exxon lawsuit might play out

exxon chevron shareholders narrowly reject climatechange stress tests supporters of proposals see victory in defeat shareholders at exxon mobil corp and chevron corp narrowly voted down resolutions calling for stress tests to determine the risk that efforts to curb climate change pose to their businesses despite the defeat the proposals drew more support than any contested climaterelated votes in the history of the two biggest us oil and gas companies preliminary results showed 41 support from chevron investors that cast ballots and 38 support at exxon an indication that more mainstream shareholders like pension funds sovereignwealth funds and asset managers are starting to take more seriously the threat of a global weaning from fossil fuels the number of shareholders supporting the climaterisk measures is significant and it will continue to grow said beth richtman investment manager at the california public employees retirement system which manages about 290 billion calpers owns about 1 billion worth of exxon shares and approximately 600 million in chevron stock theres a groundswell of share owners who are going to keep pushing this forward she said we need to see them rise to the realm of best practices in terms of climate risk reporting and were not there yet while the shareholder votes arent binding supporters of the measures declared victory even in defeat after the oil companies annual shareholder meetings wednesday you have to read this as a shot across the bow of the industry said andrew logan director of the oil and gas program at ceres a bostonbased nonprofit group that advocated for the proposals exxon and chevron had fought to keep the measures off the ballot a push that the us securities and exchange commission rebuffed separately on wednesday the white house said it planned to propose   a new rule that companies with federal contracts must disclose whether they share information about the risks that a changing climate could pose to their operations as well as their goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that rule expected to be completed this fall would affect most federal contracts the us government is a major buyer of oil products including jet fuel and diesel used by the military exxon chief executive rex tillerson said wednesday the company includes in its energy outlook a proxy cost on carbon its really the only way we know to accommodate in our financial decisionmaking the impacts of future policies that are yet to be formulated he said he added that most exxon projects are either too shortterm or too large for the theoretical cost of carbon they use in planning purposes to affect their decisionmaking exxon has also noted it published a 2014 report on managing climate risks that said none of the companys oil and gas holdings are threatened by a global push to reduce carbon emissions chevron told investors that the proposed climate measure was flawed efforts to limit warming could allow some energy producers such as those who sell natural gas to benefit while others fall out of favor including coalmining companies   chevron said the company is a large producer of natural gas and factors in a theoretical future price of carbon when deciding which projects to sanction making a stress test unnecessary the company said we dont think this proposal will advance   our thinking chevron chief executive john watson said wednesday measures of this sort have been pushed in prior years by environmental groups and activist investors but now more traditional shareholders are putting their muscle behind the proposals as concern spreads over the effect that policies to mitigate climate change could have on energy company financials those who led the filing of the exxon resolution were the church commissioners for england and the new york state common retirement fund along with others the lead filers for the chevron resolution were hermes equity ownership services and wespath investment management a division of the united methodist church investors representing more than 10 trillion in assets pledged to support   the climate proxy measures which assert that exxon chevron and other big oil companies should be transparent about how their drilling prospects would suffer if the world turned away from carbonintensive fuels including crude oil the new york state common retirement fund norways sovereignwealth fund the church of england calpers and others actively campaigned for the proposals in december nearly 200 countries pledged   in paris to hold the rise in average global temperatures to less than 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels this is the yardstick many shareholder resolutions have used to urge the companies to take greater action and show how such a goal will affect their business units supporters of that effort say more investors want to see how companies are preparing for climate change impacts a stresstest measure at occidental petroleum corp received 49 of votes and similar proposals passed overwhelmingly last year at two other big oil companies bp plc and royal dutch shell plc in a report on climate released this month total sa the french energy company said it has reduced activity in canadas oilsands region and is avoiding arctic exploration over concerns that some fossil fuels will have to stay in the ground if the goals set forth in paris are achieved conocophillips and statoil asa have issued projections that global oil demand could fall significantly by 2040 if measures to reduce climate risk are put in place by contrast exxons projection for global oil demand in that year is 28 higher than peers forecasts theres an awful lot of shareholder disquiet about how exxon is approaching climate change said edward mason head of responsible investment for the church commissioners for england which manages the assets of the church of england at the exxon annual meeting shareholders did approve one shareholder

exxons inquisitors feel the heat court filings reveal the true aim of this fraud case silencing conservatives the first thing to know about the crusade against exxon by state attorneys general is that it isnt about the law the second thing to know is that it isnt even about exxon what these liberal prosecutors really want is to shut down a universe of their mosthated ideological opponents that became startlingly clear this week with exxons latest filing in federal court the oil company revealed that it has received another subpoena for documents this one from massachusetts attorney general maura healey but ms healey whose fervor exceeds her political sense gives away the game the 17 attorneys general participating in this cause have always been careful to identify exxon as their only target its easier to accuse a big bad oil company of nefarious deeds so they make the bogus claim that exxon somehow defrauded the public and its shareholders by engaging in climate denial all the better if they can beat exxon into cutting a giant check to settle any future chargesa payoff for their states and for the trial lawyers helping them but the healey subpoena shows that exxon is a front the real target is a broad array of conservative activist groups that are highly effective at mobilizing the grassroots and countering liberal talking pointsand that therefore must as the left

oil search says exxon trumps its bid for interoil oil search said exxon has made an allscrip offer worth us45 per interoil share there are signs the deep freeze in oilindustry spending is beginning to thaw chevron corp exxon mobil corp and several partners on tuesday committed 37 billion to expand an oil project in kazakhstan known as tengiz   one of the biggest investments since crude prices collapsed two years ago last week bp plc gave the green light to a multibilliondollar gas export expansion complex it follows the uk oil giants announcement in june that it is fasttracking a major offshore gas discovery in egypt italys eni spa is moving ahead on an egypt field as well in choosing to invest now the worlds biggest energy companies get to benefit from a huge drop in drilling costs that has accompanied the oilprice fall pumps valves drilling rigs construction and engineering services steel and even labor are cheaper because the contractors that provided those services have less work than in the boom years after the financial crisis when oil prices traded around 100 a barrel the recent wave of investments may point to confidence in an oilprice recoveryafter they collapsed from around 115 a barrel in mid2014 to a low of 27 in januarybut it is still early days bigenergy company executives have said they are treating the oilprice rally with caution warning that as prices rise investment could kick in from us shale producers and american output could quickly ramp up again just on tuesday us crude prices dropped almost 5 to 4660 as traders worried about an uptick in us drilling activity a similar price rally last year had quickly fizzled since oil prices started collapsing in the summer of 2014 companies have delayed or canceled about 270 billion in projects through march including expensive arctic developments according to rystad energy great britains vote to leave the european union adds another level of uncertainty with the effect on markets   oil demand and investment still to be determined but the chevron announcement on tuesday is an inflection point said jefferies senior oil analyst jason gammel noting that it is the first investment of more than 10 billion this year tengiz is already one of the most profitable projects in the past 40 years its a terrific time to be making this sort of investment said todd levy chevrons president for exploration and production in europe eurasia and the middle east chevron is the projects operator since the start of 2015 chevron and other big oil firms have slashed their budgets by a quarterexceeding 30 billion overalland cut more than 30000 jobs to endure a prolonged period of low prices that has forced them to scour the globe for opportunities that meet a very narrow set of criteria they have to boost production in the years ahead so the companies avoid shrinking and they have to be profitable at 50 oil since prices began falling they havent often been able to find such a sweet spot last year western oil companies approved just four such major projects including in the gulf of mexico norway egypt and ghana so far in 2016 energy companies have taken the plunge on eight big expensive developments according to houston energy investment bank tudor pickering holt co and more are expected this year the bank said still these wont come online for years the first oil from the tengiz expansion for instance wont come until 2022 exxon chevron royal dutch shell plc and bp are turning to us shale wells as well those operations require less upfront investment to begin producing but also dont approach the scale or multidecade opportunity of the big projects shale producers such as pioneer natural resources inc have begun to add a small number of rigs in anticipation of higher prices at the end of 2016 they have also started tapping a vast pool of wells that were drilled but which have yet to be fracked a way to keep producing without having to spend as much money oil prices dropped across the board on tuesdaybrent the international benchmark fell to 4796 a barrel a 43 declinebut the trend is up barclays forecast this week that brent crude prices will average 57 a barrel next year up from a forecast average of 44 this year a supply glut that has weighed on prices for two years is easing thanks to outages in nigeria and canada and falling output among us shale drillers some oil companies are now able to cover their costs with prices stabilizing around 50 a barrel in recent weeks analysts said their spending cuts are allowing them to meet dividend payments and invest in new projects mr gammel said it shows that the companies are at a point where they can consider investing in longerterm projects he said oil companies are typically more comfortable making big investment decisions on future production when prices are stable tudor pickering said it believes more projects will be approved this year including bps huge deepwater project in the gulf of mexico known as mad dog ii and enis coral floating liquefiednaturalgas development in mozambique bp declined to say when it would decide on mad dog ii eni said it planned to decide on coral this year tengiz is among a handful of oilfield projects that are feasible at todays oil prices its production costs averaged around 650 a barrel over the past five years according to mr gammel some analysts estimate that it has brought chevron more than 70 billion in revenue and 40 billion in profits since 1993 when it became the first foreign oil company to strike a deal with the former soviet

walked back their subpoenas against exxon mobil corp tacitly admitting that their climatechange harassment lacks a legal basis virgin islands ag claude walker recently withdrew his subpoena of exxon mobil he was a leader among the 17 ags charging that the oil giant defrauded shareholders by hiding the truth about global warming thats hard to prove when the companys climatechange research was published in peerreviewed journals mr walker also targeted some 90 think tanks and other groups in an attempt to punish climate dissent these groups and others including these columns pushed back on first amendment grounds and the competitive enterprise institute countersued mr walker and demanded sanctions he pulled his subpoena against cei last month mr walker claimed he is dropping his exxon subpoena so the us justice department can more easily pursue its racketeering charges against the company but thats glitter on a surrender document the reason the state ags chose to pursue exxon for shareholder fraud is because anyone with legal knowledge knows how difficult it would be for the feds to bring a successful rico case to our knowledge justice doesnt even have such an investigation underway meantime massachusetts ag maura healey filed court documents declaring she wont enforce her subpoena against exxon until the oil giants countersuits against the ags are settled exxon has sued ms healey in texas federal court to quash her subpoena as a violation of its first and fourth amendment rights mrs healey clearly sensed the political dangers of dragging her office on a long antifreespeech march and is putting the investigation to the side that leaves californias kamala harris and new yorks eric schneiderman as the two remaining ags with outstanding exxon subpoenas mrs harris joined this escapade to burnish her progressive bone fides as she runs to replace retiring senator barbara boxer and her office has done little investigating mr schneiderman has the most prosecutorial leeway under his states egregious martin act which doesnt require proof of intent in civil cases but he has also been on the political defensive for trying to punish policy disagreements

the second quarter was down from a year earlier though the slide in producers performance was even worse one of the main reasons is that margins have fallen precipitously in the refining business which had been propping up the companies bottom lines as most lost money producing oil and gas fears of oversupply have gripped the market as a glut of gasoline has pushed crude prices lower just as the summer driving season ends that threatens to upend oil executives expectations that the marketand profitswould begin to stabilize over the second half of the year exxon shell chevron bp and french

of about 40 a barrel were not counting on a recovery in oil prices mr dudley said in an interview oil companies made money at 20 a barrel in the past so if were going to stay lower the whole industry

exxon official says a ban on fossil fuel is unrealistic commercial adviser for oil company speaking at conference says comments are his personal opinion san antonioan exxon mobil corp official on tuesday dismissed the growing calls by some nations to sharply curtail the use of fossil fuels or even ban them altogether as unfeasible they can sit around in the dark and talk about how it worked out ken golden commercial adviser for exxon said from the podium at an oil conference in san antonio he prefaced his comment by saying it was his personal view and that it wasnt exxons official response mr golden was giving a speech at the unconventional resources technology conference that looked at exxons energy outlook to 2040 detailing longterm energy trends the exxon official said the company is concerned about the risks climate change poses and that it encourages the use of renewable and other alternative fuels but he said for example that even while the use of wind and solar power will rise faster than any other energy source through 2040 those two will still amount to less than 3 of total energy use there are billions of people who need to read need to learn need to improve their standard of living he said you simply cannot do this without fossil fuels the fossil fuels of oil coal and natural gas are expected to provide about 80 of global energy through 2040 exxon said growing concerns over carbon emissions impact on climate change have made fossil fuelsmainly oil natural gas and coalmore unpopular than ever some climate activists have been pushing for an eventual total ban on the use of fossil fuels saying they should simply remain in the ground such ideas have gained traction in some pacific island nations that face coastal erosion and sea level rise due to climate change even oilproducing nations like norway have discussed banning fossilfuelpowered cars over the coming years exxon is involved in a monthslong political and legal fight over whether it has long known about the dangers oil poses to climate change and the environment but purposely misled the public or hid its findings mr golden said that while exxons 2040 outlook expects coal use to decline sharply oil will remain the worlds primary energy fuel and demand for oil and other liquids will grow by 20 from 2014 to 2040 it said that rising oil demand will come entirely from developing nations he said led by china and india for example while there are currently two cars per 100 people in india this will quintuple to 10 cars per 100 people by 2040 he said in the us there are 60 cars for every 100 people the risk to climate change is critical but so is raising the living standards for billions of people mr golden said we have to do both write to dan molinski at  danmolinskiwsjcom 
the climate prosecutors cant dodge congress forever the state officials who subpoenaed exxon face questions from the houseand they have to answer for a sense of how far the left will go to enforce climatechange orthodoxy read the recently released common interest agreement signed this spring by 17 democratic state attorneys general the officials pledged to investigate and take legal action against those committing climate wrongthink beginning late last year the attorneys general of massachusetts new york and the us virgin islands all signatories to the agreement issued broadranging subpoenas against exxon mobil and conservative think tanks they sought documents and communications related to research and advocacy on climate change concerned that these investigations were designed to chill first amendment rights the house committee on science space and technology issued its own subpoenas in midjuly the committee led by rep lamar smith r texas asked the attorneys general to produce their communications with environmental groups and the obama administration about their investigations they have indignantly refused to comply new york attorney general eric schneiderman claimed in a july 13 letter to mr smith that the committee was courting constitutional conflict by failing to show a due respect for federalism massachusetts attorney general maura healey in a similar letter dated july 26 asserted that the subpoenas are unconstitutional because they are an affront to states rights this view is utterly wrong federalism is a critical component of the constitutional architecture the federal government exercises only limited and enumerated powers and the states under the tenth amendment possess all other powers not delegated to the united states but when the federal government acts within its delegated powers it is entitled to supremacy over the states the supreme court has long recognized congresss power to investigate any matter within its legislative or oversight competence with that comes a corresponding power to enforce its inquiries the justices wrote in barenblatt v us 1959 that the scope of congresss power of inquiry is as penetrating and farreaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the constitution similarly in mcgrain v daugherty 1927 the court held that the power of inquirywith the process to enforce itis an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function thats why lawmakers passed a law to make contempt of a congressional subpoena a crime punishing anyone who willfully refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry the subpoenas to state attorneys general regarding their climate crusade easily fall within congresss legislative and oversight competence the house science committee has jurisdiction over matters relating to scientific research its rules authorize the chairman to issue subpoenas on behalf of the committee further congress has ample authority to investigate and sanction violations of first amendment rights that are committed by state officials for instance the ku klux klan act of 1871 includes a provisionlawyers often call it simply section 1983 referring to its place in title 42 of the us codeauthorizing monetary damages against state officials who infringe a constitutional right congresss broad investigatory power clearly extends to state officials in february the house oversight committee compelled darnell earley the emergency manager of flint mich to testify on the contamination of that citys drinking water mr earley initially refused to appear but he quickly acceded to its subpoena after the committees chairman rep jason chaffetz r utah threatened to call the us marshals to hunt him down under the supremacy clause of the constitution privileges grounded in state lawsuch as the attorneyclient privilege or workproduct privilegeare not binding on the federal government the letter to rep smith from the massachusetts attorney general for example argued that the committees subpoena seeks documents that are either attorneyclient privileged or protected from disclosure as attorney work product congress is obligated to honor neither of those statelaw privileges when congress subpoenas the white house or agencies in the executive branch there is a delicate balancing of competing constitutional interests this is because the executive often refuses to comply by invoking a presidential privilege grounded in article ii of the constitution but there is no such difficult constitutional balancing required here when congress subpoenas state attorneys general in the rightful exercise of its legislative and investigative power all assertions of state authority give way because of the supremacy clause no state officialwhether judicial legislative or executivemay resist a legitimate federal command throughout the obama administration congressional powers have been increasingly usurped by the executive the white house has unilaterally rewritten statutes ignored congressional subpoenas and arrogated to itself the power of the purse these actions have too often received the blessing of congressional democrats who have allowed partisanship to override their fidelity to the constitution and their institutional selfinterest to begin restoring congresss constitutional authority the house of representatives should push back against these state attorneys general and vigorously litigate to enforce the science committees subpoenas ms foley is a constitutional law professor at florida international university college of law

echoed by executives at bp and conocophillips in their testimony before the committee conocophillips is unlikely at this point to agree to directly participate in the feed for the project in 2017 due

committed to exploring some of the alternate project structures currently being investigated that could allow the alaska lng to proceed with construction alaska lng would transport natural gas from the north slope fields then liquefy the fuel at the facility on cook inlet for shipment to markets in asia but the proposal would be uneconomic at current lng prices or even crude oil prices under 70

how the exxon case unraveled it becomes clear that investigators simply dont know what a climate model is new york attorney general eric schneidermans investigation of exxon mobil for climate sins has collapsed due to its own willful dishonesty the posse of state ags he pretended to assemble never really materialized now his few allies are melting away massachusetts has suspended its investigation california apparently never opened one the us virgin islands has withdrawn its sweeping widely criticized subpoena of research groups and think tanks in an email exposed by a private lawsuit one staffer of the iowa ags office tells another that mr schneiderman himself was the wild card his initial claim flounced to the world by outside campaigners under the hashtag exxonknew fell apart under scrutiny this was the idea that through its own research in the 1970s exxon knew one thing about climate science but told the public something else in an aug 19 interview   with the new york times mr schneiderman now admits this approach has come a cropper he reveals that hes no longer focusing on what exxon knewsaid but instead on how it goes about valuing its current oil reserves in essence mr schneiderman here is hiding his retreat behind a recent passing fad in the blogosphere for discussing the likelihood that such reserves will become stranded assets under some imaginary future climate regime his crusade was always paradoxical the oil industry reliably ranks last in gallups annual survey of public credibility the 16 million that exxon spent between 1998 and 2005 to support organizations that criticized speculative climate models is a minuscule fraction of the propaganda budgets of the us energy department nasa noaa epa not to mention the united nations climate panel etc etc the episode ends happily though if mr schneidermans hopedfor political career now goes into eclipse but we havent finished unless we also mention the presss role the exxon knew claim recall began with investigative reports by insideclimate news and the los angeles times both suffering from the characteristic flaw of american journalismdiligently ascertaining and confirming the facts then shoving them into an offtheshelf narrative they dont support we have since learned   that both the la times via a collaboration with the columbia school of journalism and insideclimate news efforts were partly underwritten by a rockefeller family charity while rockefeller and other nonprofit groups were simultaneously stoking mr schneidermans investigation when caught with your hand in the cookie jar in this way theres only one thing to do and last week the columbia school of journalism did it awarding a prize to insideclimate news for this columnist however the deeper mystery was cleared up last year when i appeared on the npr show   to the point to discuss the subject did exxon cover up climate change google those phrases with icns energy and climate reporter neela banerjee ms banerjee has been collecting plaudits all year for her work the work itself involved revisiting exxons climate modeling efforts of the 1970s yet at 1628 see how thoroughly she bollixes up what a climate model is she apparently believes the uncertainty in such models stems from uncertainty about how much co2 in the future will be released the uncertainties that people talk about    are predicated on the policy choices we make namely the inputs of future co2 no they arent the whole purpose of a climate model is to estimate warming from a given input of co2 in its most recent report issued in 2013 the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change assumes a doubling of atmospheric co2 and predicts warming of 15 to 45 degrees celsiusie an uncertainty of output not input whats more this represents an increase in uncertainty over its 2007 report when the range was 20 to 45 degrees in fact the ipccs new estimate is now identical to exxons 1977 estimate and the 1979 estimate of the us national research council in other words on the crucial question the help were getting from climate models has not improved in 40 years and has been going backward of late for bonus insight ask yourself why we still rely on computer simulations at all rather than empirical study of climateeven though weve been burning fossil fuels for 200 years and recording temperatures even longer ok many climate reporters have accepted a role as enforcers of orthodoxy not questioners of it but this colossal error not only falsifies the work of the ipcc over the past 28 years it falsifies the entire climate modeling enterprise of the past halfcentury but it also explains the non sequitur at the heart of the insideclimate news and la times expos s as well as mr schneidermans unraveling investigation there simply never was any selfevident contradiction between exxons private and public statements in emphasizing the uncertainty inherent in climate models exxon was telling a truth whose only remarkable feature is that it continues to elude so many climate reporters

exxons accounting practices are investigated new york attorney generals probe focuses on why exxon is only oil firm not to write down value of assets amid price rout exxon mobil corp for years has kept the value of its huge oil and gas reserves steady in the face of slumping energy prices while rivals since 2014 have slashed 200 billion off their combined holdings analysts and investors have taken notice and now a wall street antagonist new york attorney general eric schneiderman is examining accounting practices at the nations largest energy company according to people familiar with the matter his office is adding scrutiny of its reserve values to its probe into exxons past knowledge of the impact of climate change   and how it could affect its future business the irving texasbased company has played down questions about its lack of assets writedowns saying it is extremely conservative in booking the value of new fields and wells that reduces its need to reduce the value of its assets if falling prices later weigh on the reserves value exxon says exxon declined to comment on the new york investigation and wouldnt disclose specifics of how it evaluates assets apart from what it has said in company filings a spokesman said exxon follows all financial rules and regulations pricewaterhousecoopers llp exxons auditor declined to comment on the investigation last year exxon chief executive rex tillerson told trade publication energy intelligence that the company has been able to avoid writedowns because it places a high burden on executives to ensure that projects can work at lower prices and holds them accountable we dont do writedowns mr tillerson told the publication we are not going to bail you out by writing it down that is the message to our organization exxons total oil and gas reserves were almost 25 billion barrels at the end of last year they include areas such as australia and the us as well as lowcost fields in qatar and indonesia it regularly reports some of the lowest acquisition costs in the industry says accounting firm ey the process of booking new reserves is complicated engineers geophysicists and geologists pore over prospects to determine if recent discoveries qualify under regulatory guidelines as a proved reserve that can be extracted costeffectively their judgments are fodder for accountants and executives who must sign off on decisions involving changes in price regulation and other factors it is unclear at this stage what impact the new york investigation may have on exxon if any mr schneiderman has broad powers to investigate corporations under new york states martin act including civil and criminal claims against companies for securities violations exxon shares fell 12 to 8403 in 4 pm trading on friday with low crude oil and natural gas prices billions of barrels of fuel in the ground cannot be tapped cost effectively making reserves revisions and writedowns staples of oilpatch earnings in recent years and helping push energy company losses to record levels in 2004 royal dutch shell plc was roiled by the admission that it had overstated its reserves the companys credit rating was downgraded several top officials were ousted and it paid penalties of 150 million to the us and uk governments exxons ability to avoid writedownsand potential charges to earnings that come with themhas been among the factors helping the company outperform rivals since prices began falling in mid2014 exxon shares have fallen by about half of the average of chevron corp shell total sa and bp plc since 2014 those four have booked more than 50 billion overall in writedowns and impairments   the company has lost money for six straight quarters in its us drilling business it has had to remove the equivalent of more than 900 million barrels of us natural gas reserves from its books in 2015 an acknowledgment that wells on those properties cannot currently be drilled cost effectively when exxon agreed to purchase shale explorer xto energy inc in 2009 for 31 billion natural gas sold for almost double what it does now for many producers such losses in net income and reserves would make writedowns inevitable but exxon didnt write down the overall value of its reserves that decision raises serious questions of financial stewardship paul sankey an oil analyst at wolfe research wrote last month it is impossible to believe that no assets have been impaired he said john herrlin an analyst at soci rale group differs he wrote last month that about three fourths of exxons reserves are from areas

potentially be drilled in the future another key to the companys assessment is the view that its assets will hold value when prices eventually rebound natural gas rose substantially in 2013 after the secs inquiry but many oil executives and forecasters have said they expect prices to remain low for some time last year exxon scrutinized its assets most at risk for impairment and found that future cash flows anticipated from its fields were substantially higher than the book value of the asset exxon does not view temporarily low prices or margins as a trigger event for conducting impairment tests according to a company filing exxon previously faced a lawsuit over its impairment practices plaintiffs including the ohio state pension system alleged in a 2004 classaction suit that the companys failure to impair its properties undercut shareholders of mobil corp in the 1999 deal that combined the companies the suit alleged that exxon should have seen writedowns of between 3 billion to 7 billion in the late 1990s another period of historically low prices it included an allegation from a former exxon insider that the company operated under an order by former chief executive lee raymond that no impairment would be recorded exxon denied the allegations the lawsuit was dismissed because the statute of limitations on such claims had passed dave michaels contributed to this

nations largest energy company according to people familiar with the matter his office is adding scrutiny of its reserve values to its probe into exxons past knowledge of the impact of climate change and how it could affect its future business the irving texasbased company has played down questions about its lack of assets writedowns saying it is extremely conservative in booking the value of new fields and wells that reduces its need to reduce the value of its assets if falling prices later weigh on the reserves value exxon says exxon declined to comment on the new york investigation and wouldnt disclose specifics of how it evaluates assets apart from what it has said in company filings a spokesman said exxon follows all financial rules and regulations pricewaterhousecoopers llp exxons auditor declined to comment on the investigation last year exxon chief executive rex tillerson told trade publication energy intelligence that the company has been able to avoid writedowns because it places a high burden on executives to ensure that projects can work at lower prices and holds them accountable we dont do writedowns mr tillerson told the publication we are not going to bail you out by writing it down that is the message to our organization exxons total oil and gas reserves were almost 25 billion barrels at the end of last year they include areas such as australia and the us as well as lowcost fields in qatar and indonesia it regularly reports some of the lowest acquisition costs in the industry says accounting firm ey the process of booking new reserves is complicated engineers geophysicists and geologists pore over prospects to determine if recent discoveries qualify under regulatory guidelines as a proved reserve that can be extracted costeffectively

writedowns  and potential charges to earnings that come with them  has been among the factors helping the company outperform rivals exxon shares have fallen by about half of the average of chevron corp shell total sa and bp plc since 2014 those four have booked more than 50 billion overall in writedowns and impairments the company has lost money for six straight quarters in its us drilling

drilled costly effectively when exxon agreed to purchase xto energy inc in 2009 for 31 billion natural gas sold for almost double what it does now for many producers such losses in net income and

exxon asset values questioned exxon mobil corp is under scrutiny for a question that is fraught for any business when should a company decide its assets literally arent worth it new york attorney general eric schneiderman is investigating why the oil giant hasnt written down the value of its assets even as others have done so due to plummeting crude prices it is an issue that is particularly knotty in the energy industry where the rules about valuing and writing down assets are complex and a lot depends on what a company expects for the future will oil prices rebound or stay below 50 a barrel the answer can make a big difference for investors  if a company decides its assets have lost value and should be written down it hurts earnings and book value or a companys net worth and the leeway allowed in making that decision means there is always a motivation for a company to be overly optimistic about the future to avoid an earnings hit today theres definitely a temptation all the time said dan amiram an associate professor of business accounting at columbia universitys business school companies will use discretion in accounting to push the envelope away from taking writedowns but some in the oil industry said exxon has a good reputation for avoiding aggressive accounting practices they think it may be justified in not writing down its assets they love stability they are one of the most compliant companies in the business said john hofmeister a former president of royal dutch shell plcs us business in a statement friday exxon said its results were in accordance with accounting and reporting rules it declined to comment on the wall street journals report of mr schneidermans investigation a spokesman for mr schneiderman declined to comment debate about writedowns isnt limited to the energy industry after the financial crisis banks faced scrutiny over decisions to avoid writedowns of some risky hardtotrade securities adding complexity to the question of when a writedown should occur in the energy industry the way oil and gas reserves are recorded as assets to begin with depends in part on whether they can be extracted and whether it is costeffective to do so the oilprice crash has led some companies to take big writedowns chevron corp for instance recorded writedowns and other noncash charges totaling 26 billion in the second quarter reflecting lower oil prices and our ongoing adjustment to a lower oil price world the company said shell took 37 billion in writedowns in 2015 to reflect a weaker longterm outlook for energy prices plus 46 billion for scrapping alaska drilling and canada oilsands projects exxon maintains the value of reserves tied to decadeslong projects shouldnt be affected by price fluctuations it views as temporary the company did acknowledge in its latest annual report that future writedowns are possible if longterm price increases dont materialize exxon is careful testing a potential investment under every price scenario before committing to it so that even a prolonged price slump wont derail the project said derek ryder a retired reservoir engineer specializing in reserves accounting who spent most of his career as an executive at exxon subsidiary imperial oil exxon is particularly reluctant to write down an asset because that removes its value permanently he noted impairment is a oneway trap door once theyre gone theyre gone said mr ryder the leeway companies have around writedowns may also make it hard for regulators to prove any wrongdoing on exxons part mr amiram said it will be very difficult in this case unless theres a smoking gun he added 
exxon asset values questioned the us securities and exchange commission is investigating how exxon mobil corp values its assets in a world of increasing climatechange regulations   a probe that could have farreaching consequences for the oil and gas industry the sec sought information and documents in august from exxon and the companys auditor pricewaterhousecoopers llp according to people familiar with the matter the federal agency has been receiving documents the company submitted as part of a continuing probe into similar issues   begun last year by new york attorney general eric schneiderman the people said the secs probe is homing in on how exxon calculates the impact to its business from the worlds mounting response to climate change including what figures the company uses to account for the future costs of complying with regulations to curb greenhouse gases as it evaluates the economic viability of its projects the decision to step into an exxon investigation and seek climaterelated information represents a moment in the effort to take climate change more seriously in the financial community said andrew logan director of the oil and gas program at ceres a bostonbased advocacy organization that has pushed for more carbonrelated disclosure from companies its a potential tipping point not just for exxon but for the industry as a whole he said as part of its probe the sec is also examining exxons longstanding practice of not writing down the value of its oil and gas reserves when prices fall people familiar with the matter said exxon is the only major us producer that hasnt taken a write down or impairment since oil prices plunged two years ago peers including chevron corp have lowered valuations by a collective 50 billion the sec is the appropriate entity to examine issues related to impairment reserves and other communications important to investors said exxon spokesman alan jeffers we are fully complying with the sec request for information and are confident our financial reporting meets all legal and accounting requirements a spokeswoman for pwc declined to comment an sec spokeswoman declined to comment a spokesman for mr schneiderman said the attorney general wouldnt comment on the matter the sec probe isnt believed to involve other energy companies according to a person familiar with the matter activists members of congress and former government officials have ratcheted up pressure on the sec in the past year to do more to assess climate risks four congressional democrats including us rep ted lieu last year asked the sec to investigate exxon over its climaterelated science and advocacy three former us treasury secretaries wrote the sec in july urging the agency to adopt industryspecific standards for disclosure in company filings a potential sticking point in the probe is what price exxon uses to assess the price of carbonthe cost of regulations such as a carbon tax or a capandtrade system to push down emissionswhen evaluating certain future oil and gas prospects people familiar with the matter said the sec is asking how exxons carbon price affects its balance sheet and the outlook for its future the people said when such a theoretical price for carbon is low more oil and gas wells would be commercially viable conversely a high carbon price would make more of exxons assets look uneconomic to pull out of the ground in future years in 2014 exxon determined that none of its assets were at risk of being rendered less valuable by impacts from the global response to climate change exxon doesnt disclose the exact price it uses to determine the commercial viability of its projectsoutside of a general range of 20 to 80 a metric ton for the futurebut many of its rivals including royal dutch shell plc and bp plc do both shell and bp said they use an internal price of roughly 40 a metric ton to decide whether to proceed with a project by contrast houstonbased conocophillips said it uses an internal carbon price range of between 6 and 51 a metric ton depending on a projects location and annual projected emissions exxon has ardently defended its record of climate research against critics as well as its view that the use of fossil fuels will grow in coming decades which corresponds to the predictions of major global energy forecasters still some investors such as the california public employees retirement system say exxon and other energy companies should acknowledge the growing global response to climate change may mean that it will never be able to tap future

oil sector investors react to sec probe of exxon over climate change many see investigation as potentially transformative moment for us companies the federal investigation of how exxon mobil corp values assets in a world of increasing climate change regulations   elicited sharp reactions on wednesday with some investors seeing it as a tipping point in a campaign to get companies to disclose climate risks and some oil industry leaders calling it a politically motivated attack but many agreed on one thing it was a potentially transformative moment for us companies which now have to worry about regulators scrutiny of future climate change impacts more seriously than before the probe by the us securities and exchange commission is focused on how exxon calculates the impact to its business from climate change including what figures the company uses to evaluate the viability of future projects the sec hasnt publicly disclosed it is investigating exxon but the probe was confirmed by an exxon spokesman on tuesday defenders of exxon saw the probe as an indication that the sec has moved into partisan politics taking up a cause championed by some democratic state attorneys general who have led probes into the companys response to climate change   it seems like to me its a witch hunt scott sheffield chief executive of oil producer pioneer natural resources co said during an industry conference wednesday adding that exxon is often a target in such matters because of its size some investors and activists meanwhile cited what they saw as exxons insularity and its refusal to face up to potential threats to its future value as a potential rationale for the sec the companys pushback amid pressure from some shareholders on the issue is emblematic of the response of many us oil and gas companies a strategy that is likely to change in the face of new sec scrutiny said anne simpson the investment director for sustainability at the california public employees retirement system exxon has not been open to the questions and concerns of its longterm investors on this issue she said five years ago it may have been plausible for exxon to say that it did not have to think about a transition in energy use but it cant say that now exxon and the sec declined to comment on wednesday the central question for companies and regulators is how the global response to climate changewhich has begun to come together after a landmark agreement to reduce emissions between nearly 200 countries in paris last yearwill affect industries from oil and gas to utilities and transportation while many companies investors and analysts agree that many industries will be affected as countries move to reduce emissions there remains considerable debate about the extent of the impact moodys investors service in june said it would begin to assess the credit implications of a transition away from carbonintensive energy use coal companies and power utilities are among the most exposed according to moodys a 2015 report by blackrock inc which manages nearly 5 trillion in assets opined that efforts to mitigate climate change will produce winners and losers that wont always be obvious some lowcost operators for example may do fine the report said for years an array of investors and activists have pressured us regulators to insist that companies do more to assess how their fortunes may rise or fall as the global effort to reduce emissions intensifies under guidance issued by the sec in 2010 companies must disclose the impact of climate change and the potential risk to their future business if it is deemed material critics say the sec hasnt done enough to force companies to tell investors more about their exposure to climate change the agency is currently looking at the possibility of imposing stiffer disclosure requirements the sec has been noticeably quiet in enforcing the climate disclosures it called for said michael gerrard an environmentallaw expert at columbia law school according to a 2014 report from ceres an advocacy group that has pushed for more corporate disclosure about the effects of climate change 41 of s p 500 companies didnt address climate change in their 2013 securities filings and those that did varied widely in the detail and quality of their disclosures some oil companies have pushed back against the idea of fuller climate change disclosures in comment letters to the sec on its current potential overhaul of disclosure requirements chevron corp said in a july letter that its annual report already contained a significant discussion about the potential risks of additional regulation of greenhouse gases and we do not believe requiring a more structured disclosure of risk would aid the reasonable investor in understanding the risks facing the company exxon weighed in last month while it didnt specifically mention climate change it said the sec should avoid promoting political social and public policy

exxon warns on reserves as it posts lower profit oil producer to examine whether assets in an area devastated by low prices and environmental concerns should be written down exxon mobil corp warned that it may be forced to eliminate almost 20 of its future oil and gas prospects yielding to the sharp decline in global energy prices under investigation   by the us securities and exchange commission and new york state over its accounting practices  and the impact of future climate change regulations on its businessexxon on friday disclosed that some 46 billion barrels of oil in its reserves primarily in canada may be too expensive to tap exxon is facing near and longterm threats as it seeks to exploit the full value of a vast oil and gas portfolio that stretches from texas to the caspian sea and deliver the handsome dividends that its shareholders have come to expect since it was part of john d rockefellers standard oil today the company is suffering amid a twoyear plunge in oil prices that has a barrel trading for around 50 a level chief executive rex tillerson believes may linger as us shale producers ramp up at the first uptick in prices prolonging the current glut and putting a ceiling on any price upswing earlier this year exxon lost the triplea bond rating it had held from standard poors rating services since 1930 a standing of creditworthiness shared with just two other companies microsoft corp and johnson johnson last year it failed to find enough new oil and gas to replace what it produced for the first time in 20 years its profits in the last 12 months are the lowest since 1999 before it merged with mobil corp exxon is alone among major oil companies in not having written down the value of its future wells as prices fell it has said it follows conservative practices in booking reserves it now plans to examine its assets to test under rules governed by accounting standards whether they are worth less than carried on its books the company said the 20 reserves reductions which are governed separately by sec rules may be necessary based on the average 2016 price by the end of the year though higher prices in november and december could mitigate the extent of the decline it added that any reserve reductions could be added back if prices recover in an investor call on friday exxon declined to discuss potential reserve writeoffs or accounting writedowns in detail beyond its statement the sec declined to comment on exxons disclosure exxon has long been the best at what they do but these external constraints are putting them more in line with everyone else forcing them to the level of their competitors said sean heinroth a principal in the energy practice at management consultancy at kearney though exxon didnt mention climate change or regulators in its disclosure most of the assets it said may not be economic are among the most scrutinized by climate change activists canadas oil sands since 1999 energy companies have invested more than 200 billion in albertas oil sands which has the third largest oil reserves behind venezuela and saudi arabia says the canadian association of petroleum producers nine of the worlds top oil companies including exxon chevron and royal dutch shell plc have been counting on wringing more canadian crude from the ground in the coming decades combined canadian crude accounts for 23 of the firms proven reserves according to data from investment bank peters coup from only 5 in 2006 new investments in the oil sands may be much harder to come by after exxons announcement said andrew logan director of the oil and gas program at ceres a bostonbased nonprofit that has pushed exxon and other companies for better disclosure on the potential impact of climate change on the energy business why would any company invest billions of dollars in a new oil sands project now given the near certainty that the world will be transitioning away from fossil fuels during the decades it will take for that project to pay back mr logan said the potential loss of reserves has broad ramifications for canada which depends on the development of its crude stores to support its economy but like other western countries has been moving to strengthen regulations to address climate change canadian prime minister justin trudeau earlier this month unveiled a national carbonpricing proposal sparking an immediate clash between the national government and the province of alberta the liberal governments proposal to charge a price for carbon emissions compounds the headwinds energy companies already face if they want to mine canadas oil sands for decades to come amy myers jaffe executive director for energy and sustainability at university of california davis said exxons warning signals that it doesnt believe oil prices will rise significantly in the near future this company had positioned itself for growth and oil sands were a key part of its strategy she said adding if lots of companies have to do write downs on their canadian reserves it sends a gloomy message about the oil sands she said longer term exxon faces headwinds from regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions measures that are widely expected to fall most heavily on its industry exxons other major obstacle us competition advanced shale drilling techniques have unleashed a new wave of american oil into world markets those drilling and fracking techniques have made smaller american companies the industrys new swing producers or those most able to ramp up

in shift exxon signals energy reserves at risk exxon mobil corp warned that it may have to cut nearly 20 of its oil and gas reserves and possibly write down some assets capitulating to the slump in global energy prices after years of keeping the value of its massive holdings steady on friday exxon disclosed that some 46 billion barrels in its reserves primarily in canada may be too expensive to tap while the company isnt yet writing down the value of those assets for accounting purposes it is acknowledging how low energy prices may impact the company for years to come analysts and investors have noted that exxon has been an outlier among energy producers in its decision to keep its reserve values steady while competitors have taken billions of dollars in writedowns new york attorney general eric schneiderman is examining the firms accounting for its reserves as well as its past knowledge of the impact of climate change on its business the us securities and exchange commission is conducting a similar inquiry in an investor call on friday exxon declined to discuss potential reserve writeoffs or accounting writedowns in detail beyond its statement the sec declined to comment exxon has long been the best at what they do but these external constraints are putting them more in line with everyone else forcing them to the level of their competitors said sean heinroth a principal in the energy practice at management consultancy at kearney exxon is facing near and longterm threats as it seeks to exploit the full value of a vast oil and gas portfolio that stretches from texas to the caspian sea and deliver the handsome dividends that its shareholders have come to expect since it was part of john d rockefellers standard oil today the company is suffering amid a twoyear plunge in oil prices that has a barrel trading for around 50 a level chief executive rex tillerson believes may linger as us shale producers ramp up at the first uptick in prices prolonging the current glut and putting a ceiling on any price upswing mr tillerson last year told a trade publication that the company avoids writedowns because it ratchets up pressure on managers to make projects work earlier this year exxon lost the triplea bond rating it had held from standard poors rating services since 1930 a standing of creditworthiness shared with just two other companies microsoft corp and johnson johnson last year it failed to find enough new oil and gas to replace what it produced for the first time in 20 years its profits in the last 12 months are the lowest since 1999 before it merged with mobil corp exxon is alone among major oil companies in not having written down the value of its future wells as prices fell it has said it follows conservative practices in booking reserves it now plans to examine its assets to test under rules governed by accounting standards whether they are worth less than carried on its books the company said the 20 reserves reductions which are governed separately by sec rules may be necessary based on the average 2016 price by the end of the year though higher prices in november and december could mitigate the extent of the decline though exxon didnt mention climate change or regulators in its disclosure most of the assets it said may not be economic are among the most scrutinized by climatechange activists canadas oil sands since 1999 energy companies have invested more than 200 billion in albertas oil sands which has the third largest oil reserves behind venezuela and saudi arabia says the canadian association of petroleum producers nine of the worlds top oil companies including exxon chevron and royal dutch shell plc have been counting on wringing more canadian crude from the ground in the coming decades combined canadian crude accounts for 23 of the firms proven reserves according to data from investment bank peters co  up from only 5 in 2006 the potential loss of reserves has broad ramifications for canada which depends on the development of its crude stores to support its economy but like other western countries has been moving to strengthen regulations to address climate change canadian prime minister justin trudeau earlier this month unveiled a national carbonpricing proposal sparking an immediate clash between the national government and the province of alberta the liberal governments proposal to charge a price for carbon emissions compounds the headwinds energy companies already face if they want to mine canadas oil sands for decades to come amy myers jaffe executive director for energy and sustainability at university of california davis said exxons warning signals that it doesnt believe oil prices will rise significantly in the near future if lots of companies have to do write downs on their canadian reserves it sends a gloomy message about the oil sands she said longer term exxon faces headwinds from regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions measures that are widely expected to fall most heavily on its industry exxons other major obstacle us competition advanced shale drilling techniques have unleashed a new wave of american oil into world markets those drilling and fracking techniques have made smaller american companies the industrys new swing producers or those most able to ramp up output quickly

mexican oil auction offers first major test of foreign firms interest bp chevron exxon petrobas expected to bid on gulf of mexico deep water oil fields mexico citymexico is preparing to auction rights to its oilrich deep waters in the gulf of mexico considered the crown jewel of the countrys energy industry which opened to foreign investment only three years ago the auction on monday is seen as the first major test of mexicos ability to work with the worlds top players at a time when low oil prices are limiting production elsewhere the deepwater blocks have caught the attention of energy giants exxon mobil corp chevron corp and bp plc and stateowned firms statoil asa of norway and petr leo brasileiro sa of brazil among others the countrys oil regulator hopes to award up to 10 unexplored deepwater blocks and find an operating partner to take a 60 stake in the trion oil field located offshore just south of the usmexico border alongside national champion petr leos mexicanos or pemex in terms of the scale of the projects this is the biggest one said juan carlos zepeda head of the national hydrocarbons commission referring to the deepwater auctions government officials expect the cost of developing all 10 of the unexplored blocks to be 34 billion over the next 15 years since an ambitious overhaul opened up mexicos oil industry to foreign and private investment in 2013 there have been three public tenders but they offered lessprofitable shallow water and inland blocks while those auctions attracted some global players such as italys eni spa the worlds largest oil companies largely watched from the sidelines this time expectations in the market are high to have a household name operating in mexicothats what they really need in order to consider this a success it would be an enormous step said steven otillar a houstonbased partner with the law firm akin gump strauss hauer feld who has worked on deals in mexicos energy industry for two decades pemexs production has been declining for more than a decade and the near exhaustion of mexicos largest oil source the cantarell shallowwater field has forced mexico to shift its attention to deepwater areas authorities estimate that around half of mexicos prospective oil resources lie in deep waters a successful tender would be a boost for a sluggish economy that is facing a gloomy outlook besieged by low oil prices steep budget cuts and uncertainty over bilateral trade following donald trumps electoral victory in the us oil prices have fallen 61 since mid2014 and pemexs production has declined 38 since 2004 to 21 million barrels a day after 75 years of state monopoly mexican president enrique pe a nieto took the audacious step of opening up the countrys energy sector as part of a broader economic overhaul intended to increase competition and investment in key sectors mr pe a nieto has made the energy reform the centerpiece of a plan to reinvent heavily indebted pemex and obtain lucrative royalties from foreign investors to fund government programs roughly 18 of mexicos federal budget comes from oil production has been in decline for the last several years so having a way to reverse that decline is key for mexicos finances said pablo medina an analyst at energy research firm wood mackenzie analysts expect trion wont produce its first barrels of oil for eight to 10 years this is a longterm fix but whoever joins pemex in trion is going to have potentially a lot of upside mr medina said the trion field was discovered in 2012 and is thought to contain about 485 million barrels of commercial reserves senior officials at the energy ministry say they would be satisfied if four deepwater blocks plus the partnership with pemex in trion are awarded stateowned pemex lacks the technical expertise to build the undersea infrastructure necessary to drill for deepwater crude oil and joining with an experienced international firm was impossible before the energy reforms developing the trion field for example will require an estimated investment of 11 billion we dont have the resources and we dont have the technology to produce deepwater oil without partners said jos antonio gonz lez anaya pemexs chief executive the level of available reserves in the 10 unexplored blocks is unclear and oil companies will compete alongside pemex for exploration and production licenses four of the blocks are located near trion in the perdido fold belt a deepwater region where giants such as royal dutch shell plc chevron and bp are already producing oil on the us side of the gulf at a rate of about 65000 barrels a day analysts also will be watching closely to see if any major oil companies make a formal bid for six additional blocks nestled in the southern elbow of the gulf of mexico known as the saline basin much less is known about potential reserves in this area compared with the active fields in the northern part of the gulf the saline basin is the great expectation said mr

rex tillerson a candidate for secretary of state has ties to vladimir putin exxon mobil ceo could redefine us interests abroad a headline on an earlier version of this article misspelled russian president vladimir putins first name as vladmir dec 6 exxon mobil corp chief executive rex tillerson who was meeting with donald trump on tuesday to discuss becoming his secretary of state is a seasoned dealmaker whose close ties to vladimir putin and other world leaders could redefine american interests abroad his emergence as a candidate to be the nations top diplomat   despite having no government experience surprised senior exxon officialsincluding mr tillerson according to people familiar with the matter friends of the 64yearold texas oilman whom they describe as a staunch conservative said they expect he would consider the job due to his sense of patriotic duty and because he is set to retire from the company next year the meeting was taking place tuesday morning at trump tower in new york according to a transition official his appointment would introduce the potential for sticky conflicts of interest because of his financial stake in exxon which explores for oil and gas on six of the worlds seven continents and has operations in more than 50 countries he owns exxon shares worth 151 million according a recent securities filing alan jeffers an exxon spokesman said mr tillerson wouldnt comment on his candidacy it is unclear how mr tillerson a strong supporter of free trade would fit ideologically with mr trump who has spoken out repeatedly against trade deals little is known of the foreignpolicy views held by mr tillerson who as secretary of state would be expected to handle any changes to the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran sanctions on russia and disputes with china the subject of repeated barbs from mr trump on the campaign trail people familiar with the transition also place mr tillerson a late entry in the presidentelects wideranging search for a secretary of state behind the three top contenders mitt romney rudy giuliani and david petraeus    friends and associates said few us citizens are closer to mr putin than mr tillerson who has known mr putin since he represented exxons interests in russia during the regime of boris yeltsin he has had more interactive time with vladimir putin than probably any other american with the exception of henry kissinger said john hamre a former deputy defense secretary during the clinton administration and president of the center for strategic and international studies a washington think tank where mr tillerson is a board member in 2011 mr tillerson struck a deal giving exxon access to prized arctic resources in russia   as well as allowing russias state oil company oao rosneft to invest in exxon concessions all over the world the following year the kremlin bestowed the countrys order of friendship decoration on mr tillerson the deal would have been transformative for exxon mr putin at the time called it one of the most important involving russia and the us forecasting that the partnership could eventually spend 500 billion but it was subsequently blocked by sanctions   on russia that the us and its allies imposed two years ago after the countrys invasion of crimea and conflicts with ukraine mr tillerson spoke against the sanctions at the companys annual meeting in 2014 we always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions he said one of the first issues mr tillerson would have to resolve as secretary of state would be his holdings of exxon shares many of which arent scheduled to vest for almost a decade the value of those shares could go up if the sanctions on russia were lifted the shares would likely have to be sold under state department ethics rules chase untermeyer a former us ambassador to qatar said in an interview he could not erase his strong relationship with a particular country mr untermeyer said the best protection from a conflict of interest is transparency mr trump has also faced repeated questions about how he will untangle himself from his realestate empire to avoid potential conflicts as president he has yet to clarify what steps he would take saying on twitter shortly after he was elected that he cant have a conflict of interest as president on nov 30 he tweeted he would soon leave his great business in total promising to disclose details at a dec 15 press conference mr tillerson has over the years shown ideological flexibility on certain topics when he deems it strategically important to the companies or institutions he has led he helped shift exxons response to climate change when he took over as ceo in 2006 he embraced a carbon tax as the best potential policy solution and has said climate change is a global problem that warrants action that was a break from his predecessor lee raymond still mr tillerson is a polarizing figure among democrats and environmental activists they have accused exxon of sowing doubt about the impacts of climate change during mr raymonds tenure and say mr tillerson hasnt done enough to disclose the future impact of climatechange regulations on the companys ability to get oil out of the ground this is certainly a good way to make clear exactly wholl be running the government in a trump administrationjust cut out the middleman and hand it directly to the fossilfuel industry said bill mckibben the environmental activist and founder of 350org exxon has disputed the criticism and accused activists and democratic attorneys general of conspiring against the company the son of a local boy scouts administrator mr tillerson was born in wichita falls texas he attended the university of texas where he studied civil engineering was a drummer in the longhorn band and participated in a community serviceoriented fraternity he joined exxon in 1975 and has spent his entire career at the company for most of his adult life he has also been closely involved with the boy scouts of america even occasionally incorporating the scout law and scout oath into his speeches mr tillerson played an instrumental role in leading the organization to change its policy to allow gay youth to participate in 2013 mr hamre said former defense secretary robert gates subsequently moved to lift the organizations ban on gay adult leaders as boy scouts president in 2015 most of the reason that organizations fail at change is pretty simple people dont understand why

senate a number of republicans have urged mr trump to be wary of russia warning that it is trying to expand its influence in ways that run counter to us interests in places such as ukraine and syria

the central intelligence agency during the obama administration but gen petraeus also faced scrutiny of his 2015 guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material in a case involving his biographer with whom he said he had an extramarital affair in addition john bolton who served as us ambassador to the united nations in the george w bush administration was a candidate with a background in diplomatic service also during the bush administration mr bolton served as the state departments counterproliferation czar and focused specifically on the iranian and north korean threats yet hes seen as one of the most hawkish members of the republican party in recent decades advocating for the us to bomb iranian nuclear sites and opposing any diplomatic negotiations with north korea he could have been at odds with mr trump on some issues given the presidentelect has suggested the us should pull back from overseas intervention mr tillersons nomination faces bipartisan resistance   in the senate over his ties to russian president vladimir putin his company has long done business in russia he has known mr putin since he represented exxons interests in russia during the regime of boris yeltsin in a sign of the close relationship the kremlin bestowed the countrys order of friendship decoration on mr tillerson after he struck a 2011 deal that gave exxon access to prized arctic resources and allowed russian state oil company oao rosneft to invest in exxon concessions around the world mr tillersons past opposition to sanctions on russia is likely to trigger blowback among senate republicans many of whom have rejected mr trumps more conciliatory stance toward the country and its president no senate republicans have yet said they would vote against mr tillerson but a number of senators expressed reservations sen marco rubio r fla a member of the foreign relations committee the panel that would hold confirmation hearings on the nomination said in a

next secretary of state would be at the forefront of any negotiations with russia on a resolution to the syrian conflict while also tending to us allies in the region who oppose the assad regime mr trumps approach to us relations with russia will be one of his most closely watched moves given his comments about russian president vladimir putin and us intelligence assessment that moscow used cyberattacks to try to help mr trump in the election republican leaders in congress recently have expressed deep misgivings about any warming to mr putin mr trump also has signaled that he wants to implement a more adversarial relationship with china   challenging beijing on trade and security measures mr trumps relations with china are already off to a rocky start with beijing balking at his

adhere to the international paris climate change agreement and to continue with the reestablishment of us relations with cuba both were among mr obamas top foreign policy initiatives and have drawn opposition from republicans mr trump hasnt specifically said whether he will roll back the deal the us and other world powers reached with iran to restrain its nuclear program though he has been a fierce critic of the agreement israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has already begun to put pressure on mr trump to back out of the deal while mr obama has tried to convince his successor that

exxon ceo rex tillerson faces senate dissent as potential state pick trumps top choice for secretary of state faces bipartisan resistance over ties to putin rex tillerson was propelled to the top of exxon mobil corp partly by negotiating a deal with vladimir putin to kickstart an oil project in russias far east one of a series of agreements between the pair stretching back to 1999 that relationship is both mr tillersons biggest claim to the nomination as donald trumps secretary of state   and potentially the biggest concern about him   in congresswhere members of both parties are pushing for an investigation into russias alleged hacking and its impact on the us election i have a very close relationship with mr putin mr tillerson told students at the university of texas his alma mater in february i dont agree with everything hes doing i dont agree with everything a lot of leaders are doing but he understands that i am a businessman and i have invested a lot of money our company has invested a lot of money in russia very successfully leading exxon mr tillersons challenge has been to get access to oil and gas deposits often in farflung nations by building relationships with leaders controlling big chunks of the worlds fossilfuel wealthsome of them strongmen on the wrong side of the us government he has done business with dictators in chad and angola and talked oil with the former libyan leader moammar gadhafi exxon didnt respond to questions about mr tillersons tenure on monday like other big oil players mr tillersons exxon partnered with companies owned by saudi arabia a longtime us ally that also been a recent target of american politicians such efforts required diplomacy of sorts but on behalf of exxon and its shareholdersas he told his texas audience that he often reminds his foreign counterparts im not here to represent the united states governments interest im not here to defend it nor am i here to criticize it thats not what i doim a businessman he said that has meant operating in a way that wasnt always aligned with us interests and sometimes without so much as a courtesy call to local us embassies according to two former us diplomats who worked in countries where exxon operated using its might as one of the worlds largest nonstateowned oil companies and one of a handful with the engineering expertise to tackle difficult projects exxon has been more direct more demanding and more likely to make takeitorleaveit offers to foreign leaders than others according to a former executive at a rival who partnered with exxon in joint ventures this is what we want mr tillerson would tell regimes the former rival said that is what you will get mr tillersons career has been defined most by his work in russia where he sometimes negotiated major deals directly with mr putin he was a rising star at exxon in the late 1990s when he was tasked with handling a politically and technologically complex oil project in russia the 17 billion development to drill for oil on russias pacific island of sakhalin   had been tied up in bureaucratic knots for years he was successful in part because he negotiated with mr putin that helped him catapult past other executives to lead the company in 2006 as the project was progressing in the early 2000s mr putins kremlin was becoming more assertive in its dealings with western oil companies which some felt had received toofavorable deals in the 1990s mr tillerson navigated that situation in part by keeping statecontrolled pao rosneft as a partner in the project rosneft has since grown to become the one of the largest publicly traded oil producers in the world mr tillerson teamed up again with rosneft in 2011 as global majors were jostling for a piece of potentially huge resources in the russian arctic bp plc chief executive robert dudley was trying to secure plum arctic fields for the ukbased oil company but his partners in another russian venture tnkbp managed to block the deal and mr tillerson swooped in at a meeting with mr putin in june 2012 mr tillerson said exxons arctic deal enhanced ties between the us and russia i agree as you point out that nothing strengthens relationships between countries better than business enterprise a kremlin transcript quoted him as saying the next year mr putin awarded him russias order of friendship for his work but the company suffered a setback in its efforts to profit from its russia dealings after the kremlin annexed crimea   and official ties deteriorated between the us and russia after moscows military intervened in eastern ukraine the obama administration added more sanctions including on russian energy companies such as rosneft forcing a halt to drilling in the arctic william w george an exxon board member until last year said mr tillerson opposed the us sanctions   but rex didnt fight it mr george said he didnt go to court mr george a former chief executive of medtronic inc who now teaches leadership as a senior fellow at harvard said mr tillersons extensive dealings with foreign leaders like mr putin should help him as secretary of state he would never put putins interests ahead of exxons when i was there said mr george under mr tillerson exxon dealt extensively with countries near the top of transparency internationals mostcorrupt list including chad papua new guinea venezuela libya iraq angola and equatorial guinea he led exxon into iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region in 2011 against the wishes of the baghdad governmentand the us state department along the way mr tillerson has sometimes run into criticism he kept pumping oil in chad for example even after international oil profits were being used to support the autocratic governments military operations in january 2006 in his first days of mr tillersons tenure at the top of exxon chadian leader idriss deby and the world bank argued over oil revenue generated by an exxonled consortium the world bank froze assets to pressure the military ruler to abide by an agreement that allowed outside groups to use some oil proceeds on health clinics and schools exxon stuck to its contract even though that meant making multimillion payments to the ruler who used the money for military protection to stay in power they had a job to do and their job was to get oil out they had a contract and they were going to stick to it said a person with direct knowledge of the situation compared with his extensive dealings with russia mr tillersons contact with china has been limited to building a large refinery and petrochemical facility in fujian province i dont think hes very well known to the chinese government leaders said victor gao a former top executive at stateowned oil company cnooc ltd mr tillersons russian oil diplomacy was on display during a visit to moscow in june when he was asked about the economic sanctions that have blocked exxon from reaping the benefits of the arcticdrilling agreement and partnership he helped broker in 2011 referring to igor sechin the head of rosneft and a close ally of mr putin he said as to the sanctions questions ill use the same approach that my friend mr sechin took thats a question for the government so if theres a us government official here whod like to respond im happy to toss it to them mr sechin burst into laughter and gave mr

secretary of state no senate republicans have yet said they would vote against mr tillerson mr corker said in a tweet saturday that the ceo is a very impressive individual still a number of senators expressed reservations on tuesday another member of the foreign relations committee sen marco rubio r fla said he had serious concerns about mr trumps selection of mr tillerson to be secretary of state mr rubio said the exxon mobil ceo is a respected businessman but the senator noted he had broader questions about whether mr tillerson was the right person for the job two days earlier mr rubio said in a tweet that being a friend of vladimir is not an attribute i am hoping for in the next secretary of state the us and its allies imposed sanctions two years ago on russia after the countrys invasion of crimea and its conflicts with ukraine importantly mr rubio didnt say tuesday that he would oppose mr tillerson only that he would do my part to ensure he receives a full and fair but also thorough hearing before the senate foreign relations committee exxon has spent years lobbying the state department on trade and energy issues including hydraulic fracturing and us relations with russia in 2014 the company lobbied the department on a bill that sought to broaden the us economic sanctions according to federal lobbying disclosures the bill didnt pass in a securities and exchange commission filing that year exxon said those sanctions were costing the company 1 billion exxon declined to comment on mr tillerson or his ties to russia mr tillerson is set to retire from exxon next year his appointment would still generate the possibility of conflicts of interest because of his financial stake in the company which explores for oil and gas on six of the worlds seven continents and has operations in more than 50 countries he owns exxon shares worth 151 million according a recent securities filing and many of those shares arent scheduled to vest for almost a decade mr tillerson has known mr putin since he represented exxons interests in russia during the regime of boris yeltsin in a sign of the close relationship the kremlin bestowed the countrys order of

around the world mr tillersons past opposition to sanctions on russia is likely to trigger blowback among senate republicans many of whom have rejected mr trumps more conciliatory stance toward the country and its president mr tillerson spoke in opposition to the sanctions on russia at exxons annual meeting in 2014 after implementation of the companys 2011 deal with russia had been blocked by the sanctions michael mcfaul who served as us ambassador to russia in the obama administration said on sunday sanctions were imposed because of russias intervention in ukraine and should only be lifted if moscow meets certain conditions i worry that because of his tillersons previous relationship with these peoplethat he would have a particular perspective on that issue he said because of a rules change pushed through by senate democrats in november 2013 most presidential nominees can be confirmed with a simple majority or 51 votes when all senators are present previously nominees needed 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles republicans will hold 52 seats in the senate next year giving them little room for internal dissension over mr trumps nominees the gop can effectively lose no more than two votes if all democrats oppose a nominee since vice presidentelect mike pence could cast a tiebreaking vote in a push that could make the margin even narrower democrats are urging sen jeff sessions r ala mr trumps nominee for attorney general to recuse himself from voting on potential cabinet colleagues mr sessions staff didnt immediately respond to a request for comment still republicans so far have treaded cautiously in opposing mr trump last week they played down their differences with the presidentelect after he called for 35 tariffs on companies that move factories out of the us a move that would fly in the face of traditional gop freemarket ideology in 2011 exxon lobbied the state department on discussions related to the colombia panama and korea free trade agreements and russias ascension into world trade organization according to the companys disclosures that year the wto cleared the way to allow russia to join a move that opened russian markets to foreign competitors by cutting tariffs and breaking down trade barriers exxon has had a continuous business presence in russia for the last two decades according to its website this year the company has lobbied the state department largely on trade and energy issues including an agreement that would open up closed sectors of chinas economy overall exxon spent 88 million on lobbying the federal government in the first three quarters of this year making it the top lobbyist in the oilandgas industry according to a center for responsive politics analysis of the most recent disclosures the companys deals in russia would be certain to come under scrutiny in senate confirmation hearings a number of republicans have urged mr trump to be wary of russia warning that it is trying to expand

planning is among the most rigorous in the industry said les csorba an executive recruiter at heidrick struggles international inc in houston who also helped manage national security appointments in the administration of president george hw bush the appointment of a major american chief executive to a cabinet post isnt without precedent according to historians who point to former secretary of defense robert mcnamara a former president of ford motor co and former secretary of defense charles wilson a former chief executive of general motors co mr wilsons stock holdings in gm became a point of conflict during confirmation hearings in 1953 during which he famously told members of congress he hadnt seen any conflict because he thought that what was good for our country was good for general motors and vice versa the business background of those appointees was less controversial because american corporations occupied a different place in american society at that time mcnamara himself as the principal architect of an unsuccessful vietnam war strategy may have elevated public and political skepticism about ceos in cabinet positions said donald hafner a professor of history at boston college exxon by contrast now confronts some of the biggest political and business obstacles it has faced since its origins as part of the 1911 breakup of john d rockefellers standard oil co exxon has struggled to find enough new oil and gas after three big bets made by mr tillerson have failed thus far to deliver on their promise it suffered a serious setback when the us and its allies imposed economic sanctions on russia in 2014 after mr tillerson brokered a major arctic drilling deal with the country in 2011 the company also poured billions into canadas oil sands over the last decade but in october told investors it recognized as many as 46 billion barrels of future reserves primarily in canada may no longer be profitable to produce at todays prices and it got into the shale drilling boom late with a purchase of xto energy inc valued at 31 billion when it was announced in 2009 earlier this year exxon lost the sterling triplea credit rating from standard poors it had held since before the great depression last year it failed to replace all of the oil and gas reserves that it produced for the first time in more than two decades if the trump administration lifts sanctions on russia and exxon reboots its energy partnership with rosneft the company stands to reap billions in profits back in the us however exxon is embroiled in several disputes including an investigation opened earlier this year by the us securities and exchange commission over how exxon accounts for its oil and gas reserves and communicates with investors about climate change exxon is also in a

how rex tillerson a late entry to be secretary of state got donald trumps nod exxon ceo wasnt on anyones radar until a former defense secretary suggested him to the presidentelect presidentelect donald trump was three weeks into his search for a secretary of state when former defense secretary robert gates arrived at his new york office for a private talk the cabinet selection was bedeviling mr trump his first instinct to pick a loyal insider was undercut by reports of the prospective nominees overseas moneymaking ventures and his flirtation with a known political adversary was being hammered by his own supporters what if he asked mr gates he wiped the slate clean and started over the former pentagon chief offered a name that was on no ones radar and one whose company happened to be one of his clients exxon mobil corp head rex tillerson four days later mr trump held his first interview with mr tillerson and was blown away a transition official said adding that sort of reshuffled the deck on tuesday mr trump ended a messy fiveweek search for the plum cabinet post selecting mr tillerson from upwards of 10 candidates who included campaign backers foreignpolicy experts and established politicians mr trumps handling of the search offers an early window into an executive style that leaves even his own advisers guessing at what he will do right up until the last moment he also went ahead with the tillerson pick in the face of bipartisan resistance from senators who are wary of the oil executives business ties to russian president vladimir putin which run deep enough that mr tillerson was named to russias order of friendship in 2013 as those concerns were aired publicly on monday mr trump became even more determined to buck the establishment and select mr tillerson a transition official said its important to know that the one thing mr trump understands is that hes in charge said ed brookover a former political adviser to mr trump there can be all sorts of speculation and talking about whats going on but a decision isnt made until he makes it the upshot though is that winning senate confirmation might not be easy and mr trump may need to spend considerable political capital to install mr tillerson in the job from the outset the search and selection of the next secretary of state took on a life of its own even as the trump transition team set a brisk pace for filling other highlevel positions initially former new york mayor rudy giuliani emerged as what seemed to be the prohibitive favorite he topped the short list of candidates that trump advisers handed the presidentelect on nov 9 the day after the election mr giuliani had stood by mr trump during the bleakest moments of his candidacy and was a frequent visitor to trump tower during the transition at a wall street journal ceo council event on nov 14 mr giuliani privately told attendees he would land the job and he talked up his security contracts and paid speechmaking overseas as part of his r  on stage he was asked who would be a better secretary of state than john bolton a former diplomat also considered for the post mr giuliani replied maybe me i dont know but mr trump wasnt completely sold one transition official said the presidentelect was concerned mr giuliani 72 years old might not have the necessary stamina for a job my stamina is unbelievable mr giuliani said in an interview on tuesday meanwhile other unexpected candidates began to emerge chief among them was mitt romney the 2012 republican presidential nominee who had become the primary voice of the never trump corner during the primaries the new york businessman met mr romney at his golf club in new jersey on nov 19 at the suggestion of his top strategic adviser steve bannon who wanted to show party unity before the media cameras but the meeting went so well that mr romney emerged as the frontrunner for the job to the chagrin of mr bannon who had run breitbart news a website that was critical of mr romney by nov 22 three days after that first meeting mr trump told associates that he was 95 of the way to picking mr romney two days later trump senior adviser kellyanne conway tweeted that she was getting a deluge of comments about mr romneys prospective appointment from trump loyalists who hadnt forgiven him for his remarks during the campaign including calling mr trump a phony a fraud ms conway who took her warnings onto the sunday morning news shows wasnt freelancing people familiar with the matter said she was acting with mr trumps approval mr romney played his cards close making personal appeals to his allies to remain silent about the process in deference to mr trump according to people familiar with mr romneys planning the former massachusetts

confirmation battle looms for rex tillerson as secretary of state some republican senators question the exxon mobil ceos closeness to russian leaders washingtondonald trump pushed ahead tuesday with his controversial pick for secretary of state exxon mobil corp chief rex tillerson setting up a likely battle with senatorsincluding some republicanswho have raised questions about his closeness to russian leaders republican sens marco rubio john mccain and lindsey graham influential voices in the chamber on foreignpolicy issues want to use the confirmation process to explore mr tillersons relationship with russian president vladimir putin mr rubio went the furthest saying tuesday he had serious concerns about the nominee the worries from republicans signaled mr tillerson could face trouble getting confirmed in the senate where he could lose no more than two gop votes if all democrats oppose him mr tillerson was officially unveiled as the presidentelects choice tuesday morning after a long interview process that featured multiple candidates including former new york city mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov mitt romney mr trump called the executives life story the embodiment of the american dream and suggested his business background would empower mr tillerson to cut deals as americas top diplomat senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky praised mr tillerson for his forwardlooking strategic planning managing international partnerships and risk and focused leadership around the world he played down concerns over mr tillersons ties to russia by saying he was confident he will face each problem head on with american interests and security as his top priority mr tillerson also has the support of former secretary of state condoleezza rice former defense secretary bob gates and former national security adviser stephen hadley the trump team noted the three are partners in an international consulting firm that has worked for exxon the foreign relations committee chairman bob corker r tenn who was himself a candidate for the state department post said mr tillerson is a very impressive individual and has an extraordinary working knowledge of the world tom pritzker a billionaire chicago businessman who serves with mr tillerson on the board of the bipartisan center for strategic and international studies in washington described mr tillerson as a brilliant choice he will be totally focused on us national interests mr pritzker said its a mistake to confuse knowing russia with being prorussia rex knows russia which means hes ahead on the learning curve transition officials suggested some centrist democrats might back mr tillerson given his position on climate change which he has said is a global problem that warrants action sen chris coons d del a member of the foreign relations panel expressed concerns over what he viewed as mr tillersons potential conflicts but said he was intrigued by reports the nominee had supported a carbon tax i didnt expect that from an oilandgas executive he said mr coons added that he was skeptical that would shape the trump administrations climate policy given that mr trump last week tapped climate skeptic oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt to lead the environmental protection agency under mr tillersons leadership exxon has embraced a carbon tax as the best policy to address climate change and this year the company stepped up its lobbying of fellow us oilandgas companies to back a carbon tax over no climate policy at all the oil giant also backs a global deal struck in paris last year to cut greenhouse gas emissions but russia appears to be the main concern of senators of both parties a number of republicans have signaled they expect confirmation hearings in the foreign relations committee to focus on questions about his relationship and business dealings in russia as well as his opposition to us sanctions against russia hes also likely to draw similarly tough scrutiny from many democrats in the senate who plan to use the confirmation hearings as a public forum on the nomination even if they lack the votes to halt it under his leadership exxon signed a joint agreement with the stateowned russian oil company rosneft on a drilling project mr tillerson was later awarded the russian order of friendship because of the deal republicans will control 52 seats in the senate to 48 held by democrats and the two independents who caucus with them that means mr tillerson can lose no more than two gop votes in the senate if all democrats oppose him the foreign relations committee in the most recent session had 10 republican and nine democratic members the panels composition in the next congress is still being worked out but it is likely mr tillerson would need to offset any gop defections with support from democrats to win a positive confirmation recommendation from the panel the top foreign relations panel democrat ben cardin of maryland said he was deeply troubled by mr tillersons vocal opposition to us sanctions on russia following its illegal invasion occupation and annexation of crimea ukraine and his close personal relationship with vladimir putin i also want to know more about mr tillersons worldview because i found many of presidentelect trumps foreignpolicy statements as a candidate and now as the next president of the united states to be disturbing at best and frightening at worst mr cardin said mr rubio a florida republican and foreign relations committee member didnt say he would oppose mr tillersononly that he would do my part to ensure he receives a full and fair but also thorough hearing mr mccain of arizona the republican 2008 presidential candidate told npr this week he too had concerns about what kind of business we do with a butcher a murderer and a thug which is exactly what vladimir putin is mr graham of south carolina said that while mr tillerson was a talented businessman he expected the usrussian relationship to be front and center in his confirmation process other senate republicans also expressed reservations about mr tillersons ties to russiathough without opposing the nomination outright a spokesman for nebraska gop sen ben sasse who has been a vocal critic of mr trump said the senator looks forward to diving into every nominees record mr tillerson is a man of tremendous accomplishment but us policy toward russias sovietstyle aggression demands rigorous oversight sen chuck grassley an iowa republican warned that both trump and tillerson need to know that putin is machiavellian and added that presidents barack obama and george w bush were hoodwinked by the russian leader mr trumps team described mr tillerson as a selfmade man and said his international business dealings should be considered an asset not a concern you can see he is not only a successful businessman but someone who really has that sort of american dream story of rags to riches said sean spicer a trump spokesman only three cabinet nominees have been rejected in the 20th century and none this century the last time was in 1989 when former sen john tower george hw bushs nominee to be defense secretary was rejected by a democratic senate in other cases nominees have withdrawn rather than face a vote that they were certain to lose damian paletta

will the media forgive trump for winning plus exxons ceo could go wobbly on fossil fuels rex tillerson rose to the top of exxon mobil corp partly by negotiating a deal with russias vladimir putin to kickstart an oil project on the pacific ocean island of sakhalin which had been tied up in bureaucratic knots for years he also led exxon into iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region against the wishes of baghdad and the state department and kept pumping oil in chad after international oil profits were being used to support the autocratic governments military operations in many ways mr tillersons record since becoming chief executive in 2006 makes him the international energy equivalent of presidentelect donald trumps claim to fame in real estate a shrewd opportunistic businessman who amassed daring investments and valuable assets around the world those same qualifications will also pose a test for mr tillersons nomination by the presidentelect as secretary of state   the exxon ceos dealings outside the us particularly in russia will be a feature of his confirmation review testing whether mr trumps affection for corporate chieftains   as cabinet chiefs will fly in the world of international diplomacy mr trump has praised mr tillerson 64 years old for having relationships with leaders all over the world that are second to none other prominent supporters acclaim his wide knowledge of the world and note his experience outside corporate america including as president of the boy scouts of america its a mistake to pigeonhole him as another ceo with a very narrow background said former defense secretary robert gates in an interview mr gates a principal in a consulting firm that has exxon as a client said he recommended mr trump consider mr tillerson for the job his relationship with russias president which stretches back to 1999 is already facing scrutiny from lawmakers in the senate   who will oversee his confirmation hearings next month members of both parties are also pushing for an investigation into russias alleged hacking and its impact on the us election us officials and european leaders have accused russia of illegally annexing part of ukraine and supporting bombing campaigns in syria that have killed thousands of civilians mr trump has said he would pursue less confrontation with russia on the issues the real issue with rex tillersons candidacy is going to be about donald trumps unusual views of russia said r nicholas burns a career foreign service officer who rose to be a top senior state department official in the george w bush administration will the trump administration the president he serves have a rational toughminded approach to russia right now i dont see it testing his skill set a key test of mr tillersons skill set will be how well he can translate his business acumen to international diplomacy can he step out of the exxon mobil persona and then pursue a whole bunch of interests with interlocutors who dont share our interests said steven pifer a retired foreign service officer who spent 25 years at the state department and served as us ambassador to ukraine not enough was known about mr tillersons views on foreign policy to form a view mr pifer added as secretary of state you are a juggler you are a diplomat you are a cage fighter and you need to be bureaucrat par excellence or the permanent bureaucracy of the foreign service will destroy you said danielle pletka a senior vice president at the conservativeleaning american enterprise institute while mr tillerson is unusual for his lack of prior government experience other business leaders have moved into cabinet posts and other highranking government positions george shultz served for seven years as secretary of state under president ronald reagan after rising to president of international engineering firm bechtel inc prior to bechtel mr shultz spent five years in several top washington posts including as treasury secretary other prominent cabinet secretaries with top corporate experience include former defense secretaries caspar weinberger who also worked at bechtel and robert mcnamara who served as president of ford motor co before becoming george w bushs vice president dick cheney spent five years as the chief executive of halliburton co mr tillerson joined exxon in 1975 as he climbed the corporate ladder he faced a common challenge at big multinational oil companies build relationships with leaders controlling chunks of the worlds fossilfuel wealth some of those leaders were strongmen on the wrong side of the us government along with mr putin mr tillerson has done business with dictators in angola and chad and talked oil with former libyan leader moammar gadhafi under mr tillerson exxon joined with companies owned by saudi arabia a longtime us ally that has been a recent target of american politicians its his work in russia that has attracted the most attention in the senate particularly from defense hawks who worry mr putin will continue trying to thwart us interests i have a very close relationship with mr putin mr tillerson told students at the university of texas his alma mater in february i dont agree with everything hes doing i dont agree with everything a lot of leaders are doing but he understands that i am a businessman and i have invested a lot of money our company has invested a lot of money in russia very successfully mr tillerson often used diplomacy of sorts to make international oil deals but those were on behalf of exxon and its shareholders im not here to represent the united states governments interest he told his texas audience in recounting his conversations with foreign officials im not here to defend it nor am i here to criticize it thats not what i doim a businessman mr tillerson said that has meant operating in ways not always aligned with us interests and sometimes without heeding the requests of local us embassies according to two former us diplomats who worked in countries where exxon operated tough negotiations exxon has been more direct and more demanding with foreign leaders than other companies according to a former executive at a rival who was a partner with exxon in joint ventures in china by contrast a country that will be a big part of mr tillersons portfolio if he is confirmed his contact with government leaders has been limited to building a large refinery and petrochemical facility in fujian province i dont think hes very well known to the chinese government leaders said victor gao a former top executive at stateowned oil company cnooc ltd in russia mr tillerson sometimes worked on deals directly with mr putin the exxon executive was a rising star at the company at the end of the 1990s when he handled the politically and technologically complex project on sakhalin   a 17 billion development to drill for oil mr putin became russian prime minister in 1999 and has run the country either as president or prime minister ever since mr tillersons success including on the sakhalin deal helped him catapult past other executives to lead exxon as the project was progressing in the early 2000s mr putins kremlin was becoming more assertive in its dealings with western oil companies which some felt had received toofavorable deals in the 1990s mr tillerson navigated that situation in part by keeping statecontrolled pao rosneft as a partner in the project rosneft has since grown to become one of the worlds largest publicly traded oil producers mr tillerson teamed up again with rosneft in 2011 as global majors were jostling for a piece of potentially huge resources in the russian arctic bp plc chief executive robert dudley was trying to secure plum arctic fields for the ukbased oil company but his partners in another russian venture tnkbp managed to block the deal mr tillerson swooped in at a june 2012 meeting with mr putin mr tillerson said exxons arctic deal enhanced usrussian ties i agree as you point out that nothing strengthens relationships between countries better than business enterprise a kremlin transcript quoted him saying an award from putin the next year mr putin awarded mr tillerson russias order of friendship for his work exxon suffered a setback in its efforts to profit from its russia dealings after the kremlin annexed crimea at the time part of ukraine   and ties deteriorated between the us and russia after moscows military intervened in eastern ukraine the obama administration added more sanctions including on russian energy companies such as rosneft forcing a halt to drilling in the arctic william w george an exxon board member until last year said mr tillerson opposed the us sanctions   yet rex didnt fight it he said he didnt go to court mr george a former chief executive of medtronic inc who now teaches leadership as a senior fellow at harvard business school said mr tillersons extensive dealings with foreign leaders like mr putin should help him as secretary of state he would never put putins interests ahead of exxons when i was there said mr george mr tillersons russian oil diplomacy was on display during a visit to moscow in june when he was asked about the economic sanctions that have blocked exxon from reaping the benefits of the arcticdrilling agreement and partnership that he helped broker in 2011 referring to igor sechin the head of rosneft and a close ally of mr putin mr tillerson said as to the sanctions questions ill use the same approach that my friend mr sechin took thats a question for the government so if theres a us government official here whod like to respond im happy to toss it to them mr sechin burst into laughter and gave mr tillerson a thumbsup russell gold joann s lublin brian spegele and

ambassador to ukraine not enough was known about mr tillersons views on foreign policy to form a view mr pifer added as secretary of state you are a juggler you are a diplomat you are a cage fighter and you need to be bureaucrat par excellence or the permanent bureaucracy of the foreign service will destroy you said danielle pletka a senior vice president at the conservativeleaning american enterprise institute while mr tillerson is unusual for his lack of prior government experience other business leaders have moved into cabinet posts and other highranking government positions george shultz served for seven years as secretary of state under president ronald reagan after rising to president of engineering firm bechtel inc prior to bechtel mr shultz spent five years in several top washington posts including as treasury secretary other prominent cabinet secretaries with top corporate experience include former defense secretaries caspar weinberger who also worked at bechtel and robert mcnamara who served as president of ford motor co before becoming george w bushs vice president dick cheney spent five years as the chief executive of halliburton co mr tillerson joined exxon in 1975 as he climbed the corporate ladder he faced a common challenge at big multinational oil companies build relationships with leaders controlling chunks of the worlds fossilfuel wealth some of those leaders were strongmen on the wrong side of the us government along with mr putin mr tillerson has done business with dictators in angola and chad and talked oil with former libyan leader moammar gadhafi under mr tillerson exxon joined with companies owned by saudi arabia a longtime us ally that has been a recent target of american politicians its his work in russia that has attracted the most attention in the senate particularly from defense hawks who worry mr putin will continue trying to thwart us interests i have a very close relationship with mr putin mr tillerson told students at the university of texas his alma mater in february i dont agree with everything hes doing i dont agree with everything a lot of leaders are doing but he understands that i am a businessman and i have invested a lot of money our company has invested a lot of money in russia very successfully mr tillerson often used diplomacy of sorts to make international oil deals but those were on behalf of exxon and its shareholders im not here to represent the united states governments interest he told his texas audience in recounting his conversations with foreign officials im not here to defend it nor am i here to criticize it thats not what i do  im a businessman mr tillerson said that has meant operating in ways not always aligned with us interests and sometimes without heeding the requests of local us embassies according to two former us diplomats who worked in countries where exxon operated exxon has been more direct and more demanding with foreign leaders than other companies according to a former executive at a rival who was a partner with exxon in joint ventures in china by contrast a country that will be a big part of mr tillersons portfolio should be be confirmed his contact with government leaders has been limited to building a large refinery and petrochemical facility in fujian province i dont think hes very well known to the chinese government leaders said victor gao a former top executive at stateowned oil company cnooc ltd in russia mr tillerson sometimes worked on deals directly with mr putin the exxon executive was a rising star at the company at the end of the 1990s when he handled the politically and technologically complex project on sakhalin a 17 billion development to drill for oil mr putin became russian prime minister in 1999 and has run the country either as president or prime minister ever since mr tillersons success including on the sakhalin deal helped him catapult past other executives to lead exxon as the project was progressing in the early 2000s mr putins kremlin was becoming more assertive in its dealings with western oil companies which some felt had received toofavorable deals in the 1990s mr tillerson navigated that situation in part by keeping statecontrolled pao rosneft as a partner in the project rosneft has since grown to become one of the worlds largest publicly traded oil producers mr tillerson teamed up again with rosneft in 2011 as global majors were jostling for a piece of potentially huge resources in the russian arctic bp plc chief executive robert dudley was trying to secure plum arctic fields for the ukbased oil company but his partners in another russian venture tnkbp managed to block the deal mr tillerson swooped in at a june 2012 meeting with mr putin mr tillerson said exxons arctic deal enhanced usrussian ties i agree as you point out that nothing strengthens relationships between countries better than business enterprise a kremlin transcript quoted him saying the next year mr putin awarded mr tillerson russias order of friendship for his work exxon suffered a setback in its efforts to profit from its russia dealings after the kremlin annexed crimea at the time part of ukraine and ties deteriorated between the us and russia after moscows military intervened in eastern ukraine the obama administration added more sanctions including on russian energy companies such as rosneft forcing a halt to drilling in the arctic william w george an exxon board member until last year said mr tillerson opposed the us sanctions yet rex didnt fight it he said he didnt go to court mr george a former chief executive of medtronic inc who now teaches leadership as a senior fellow at harvard business school said mr tillersons extensive dealings with foreign leaders like mr putin should help him as secretary of state he would never put putins interests ahead of exxons when i was there said mr george mr tillersons russian oil diplomacy was on display during a visit to moscow in june when he was asked about the economic sanctions that have blocked exxon from reaping the benefits of the arcticdrilling agreement and partnership that he helped broker in 2011 referring to igor sechin the head of rosneft and a close ally of mr putin mr tillerson said as to the sanctions questions ill use the same approach that my friend mr sechin took thats a question for the government so if theres a us government official here whod like to respond im happy to toss it to them mr sechin burst into laughter and gave mr tillerson a thumbsup russell gold joann s lublin brian spegele and joe parkinson contributed to this article from top corporate jobs to the cabinet and white house robert mcnamara defense secretary president of ford motor co mr

exxon faces dilemma on rex tillersons pay now that the ceo is donald trumps pick for secretary of state granting a 175 million stock award could open the company to criticism exxon mobil corps board faces a difficult decision over how to make a financial break with chief executive rex tillerson who will step down at years end now that donald trump has chosen him as secretary of state   the oil giant which announced mr tillersons departure wednesday is considering whether to grant him more than 175 million in stock compensation that he is currently eligible for only upon hitting the retirement age of 65 in march the board also has to decide whether to grant the shares immediately instead of over years allowing mr tillerson to retire early and cash out would be a break from company policy under which vesting occurs after a decade it could also open exxon to criticism it is giving mr tillerson a gift as he heads to a government post in which he could have vast influence over exxons fortunes however if the cabinet nominee is able to fully divest his exxon holdings   that would alleviate concerns over how he could personally benefit from state department actions that help exxon the board is weighing the matter now according to people familiar with the matter whatever the company decides the issue is certain to become a flashpoint in what is already expected to be an explosive senate confirmation process exxon directors announced they will quicken the companys planned succession to elevate darren woods    51 to the position of chief executive mr woods who had been anointed as mr tillersons heir apparent will officially take the post jan 1 in its statement exxon didnt address the matter of tillersons compensation while the company could try to dodge the issue by not giving mr tillerson the added compensation he was set to receive in a few months it would mean shortchanging a 41year employee of his anticipated retirement windfall the decision is one example of the corporate tumult created by mr trumps decision to tap so many sitting executives for his cabinet in addition to mr tillerson others include  gary cohn the secondincommand at goldman sachs group inc   and  andy puzder chief executive of hardees parent cke restaurants   cashing out mr tillerson may be the best of several bad options for exxon which is trying to avoid the conflictofinterest scrutiny that followed halliburton co when dick cheney who had been the companys chief executive was elected vice president as part of george w bushs administration in 2000 halliburtons board voted to grant mr cheney early retirement a step that allowed him to receive a departure package worth about 20 million he sold shares of the oilfieldservices company worth more than 30 million during the campaign but he retained hundreds of thousands of stock options and sold them gradually during his time in office donating any profits to charity the tillerson conundrum will surely put the companys board in a tough spot said robert jackson a corporategovernance expert at columbia university exxons directors have to ask themselves whether a public servant should be receiving a 175 million gift from a private corporation mr jackson said this is a classic catch22 said charles elson a professor of governance at the university of delaware youre damned if you do and youre damned if you dont theyre in a tough position there is no easy answer to this one the companys compensation structure was clearly designed to prevent someone from reaping a windfall if they were to leave early to join a competitor or under circumstances that the board disapproves of but mr tillerson is going into public service mr elson said mr tillerson had 2 million unvested shares as of this month which were worth 184 million at tuesdays closing price according to securities filings he also owns shares worth at least 55 million that have already vested and a pension valued at about 69 million as of yearend 2015 exxon shares have risen 16 this year and 6 in the postelection stock market rally according to exxons compensation rules the board can decide whether to let executives such as mr tillerson keep the unvested shares if they depart before turning 65 the board also can accelerate the receipt of unvested shares something the company usually doesnt do except in the case of a death before the vesting period is up according to securities filings such compensation policies apply to more than 1000 executives at the oil company where officials take pains to emphasize that the same rules apply to the ceo as everyone else exxon designed the pay packages to push its senior leaders to think about longterm returns accelerating stock grants for executives entering public

inside rex tillersons negotiating style cozy with power unbending and theatrical senate to weigh if exxon chiefs experience with multibilliondollar international deals prepares him to be secretary of state moscowin the spring of 2014 after the us punished russia with sanctions for seizing ukrainian territory rex tillerson made a major decision the exxon mobil corp chief executive now  donald trumps nominee for secretary of state   would deepen his companys longstanding partnership with the kremlin during negotiations the ceo of rosneft the kremlins statecontrolled oil company looked over a proposed contract related to the pairs operations off sakhalin island in russias far east and scowled said a person with knowledge of the meeting exxon he said put language in the contract he didnt expect he looked at mr tillerson and tore it up mr tillerson the person said leaned back put his hands together smiled silentlyand waited with billions of dollars already invested the russians had few other options rosnefts ceo a former intelligence officer and top putin ally named igor sechin eventually backed down and an agreement was struck a look at mr tillersons negotiating style honed over years at the head of one of the worlds largest oil companies shows an executive determined to hold the course even when the landscape shifts dramatically personal relationships were often a deciding factor so were deliberately theatrical tactics such as preplanned temper tantrums and silent stareoffs the question for the senate which is expected to consider mr tillersons nomination on wednesday is to what extent this kind of expertise prepares him for the job of secretary of state he has vast experience hammering out multibilliondollar deals that potentially span decades with government leaders of all stripes on the other hand a company is not a country the former exxon chiefs dealings with rosneft are likely to be a major line of questioning   from both republicans and democrats many of whom have said they are uncomfortable with mr tillersons close ties there in the wake of russias alleged hacking attack   on figures in the democratic party the russia deals added hundreds of millions of dollars to exxons bottom line and billions of barrels of potential reserves to bolster the companys future production at the same time they ran afoul of state department priorities at a time when the us was using sanctions to try to check russian military interventions in ukraine for exxon one of the worlds largest publicly traded oil companies the results of the russia deals are mixed the deals struck in 2014 which technically expanded projects already in operation didnt violate sanctions which targeted the spread of oil and gas technology but other projects especially a vast arctic investment ground to a halt blocking exxons access to rich reserves it hoped would ease its longtime struggle to find new resources   this is an industry with very long timelines said alan jeffers an exxon spokesman the current situation prevents us from activities in the area that are sanctioned but we see that as a pause mr tillerson declined to comment mr sechin and rosneft didnt respond to emailed questions mr tillerson who joined exxon in 1975 and became ceo in 2006 specialized in the types of deals that typified the oil industry in the runup to the recent price crash giant agreements sometimes in unstable places that cost billions of dollars to develop and aimed to produce huge volumes of oil and gas over decades he spent hours with the companys negotiating teams preparing for every potential aspect and plotting tactics including the theatrical according to people he worked with in a meeting in yemen in the 1990s he threw a book and stormed out of talks the tantrum was preplanned one person said anger is a strategy not an emotion mr tillerson told colleagues he negotiated deals worth more than the gdp of some countries with officials who had vast power but lacked expertise that meant he dealt with concerns other than money such as a leaders desire for exxon to educate local workers or help a stateowned oil company gain technology he drank tea with tribal leaders and showed off exxon facilities to visiting dignitaries in interactions with russian leaders mr tillerson avoided giving any impression of american superiority especially amid the postcold war tensions of the 1990s in a 2004 interview with the wall street journal he described how when a russian minister in the 1990s slammed his fist on the bargaining table in a dispute over a permit raising images of former soviet leader nikita khrushchev he gingerly brought him back to the discussion you make yourself very aware of it and almost go out of your way to make sure theres nothing that conveys a superior attitude he said at the same time he rarely budged on terms seeking to project strength said people familiar with his negotiating style mr tillerson arrived in postsoviet russia in 1997 to chase the same prize as every other big western oil executive access to the countrys vast stores of untapped crude he set up in a suite in the metropol hotel just steps from red square and tried to make sense of a kremlin in turmoil russia cycled through six prime ministers in mr tillersons first 14 months even before the musical chairs ended with mr putin in charge in 1999 exxon realized something its western rivals didnt joining with the kremlin could shield the company from hostile takeovers by other stateowned firms and regulatory obstacles from the russian government at a time when other western oil giants dismissed stateowned companies as too bureaucratic and inflexible exxon committed to an ambitious project with rosneft to develop an oil and gas field near sakhalin island it would cost billions of dollars to develop and be one of the most technically complex projects in exxons history with oil and gas deep beneath sea ice in an area prone to earthquakes and 50foot waves over the years it would be expanded multiple times in the past decade the partners have produced more than 300 million barrels from three separate fields with a potential peak of 200000 barrels a day exxon said mr tillerson had a key person on the ground a personable russianspeaking croat named zeljko runje who formed close relationships with rosneft executives and years later would help pull off an even bigger russian deal for exxon when it first partnered with exxon rosneft had no equipment they had no technology a former rosneft executive said exxons expertise and financing helped build rosneft into one of the worlds largest producers which strengthened russian president vladimir putins grip on power energy revenues allowed him to boost spending at home and to project power abroad rosnefts dominance gave him control of russias most important industry in 2004 the kremlin seized assets from oao yukos then the countrys largest oil company and rosneft took control of its main production unit becoming the countrys secondlargest producer exxon worked closely with moscow to devise legislation on taxation and other issues that affected its investment according to igor yusufov russias energy minister from 2001 to 2004 mr tillerson met with ministers and gave suggestions for legislation mr yusufov said he met everyone the russian said he helped us to formulate the relationship between the state and investors during a usrussia energy summit in houston in 2002 mr tillerson wooed mr yusufov with a trip to exxon facilities where he showed the russian minister a 3d model of the sakhalin project as it was at the time and as it would look at peak production mr tillerson worked closely with rosneft executives as the project began producing in 2005 he and thenrosneft ceo sergey bogdanchikov landed their private jets at tiny teterboro airport in suburban new jersey in 2006 and discussed sakhalin and rosnefts coming initial public offering said a person familiar with the talk mr sechin who had spent years in intelligence in africa and elsewhere and later became a kremlin political operative close to mr putin had become chairman of rosneft in 2004 he took over as ceo in 2012 with the aim of extending its reach his underlings quickly came to fear his 3 am calls ordering them to pack for a trip to asia as much as his outbursts at meetings over frustrations like project delays former executives said he and mr tillerson developed a comfortable rapport said people who attended their meetings mr sechin was careful to show mr tillerson he had the highestpossible backing two or three times a year or more mr sechin would ask mr putin to speak by phone or in person with mr tillerson said one of the people mr sechin came to like mr tillerson because he was transparent and forceful in his communicationsand was one of the few western executives strong enough to push back against mr sechin said people familiar with the matter the relationship helped exxon land one of its biggest coups in 2011 exxon rival bp plc reached a deal for access to a giant rosneftcontrolled arctic field but bps oligarch partners in a separate russian joint venture blocked the deal exxons longtime russia hand mr runje who had been key to the sakhalin project more than a decade earlier saw an opening and sent a message to mr tillerson said people familiar with the matter mr runje declined to comment messrs tillerson and sechin hashed out a 32 billion deal that was to be one of the biggest exploration contracts ever it gave exxon access to the arctic fields bp lost as well as basins in siberia and in the black sea mr putin who had come to trust mr tillerson as a man of his word blessed the deal and said investment could eventually reach 500 billion mr putin later awarded mr tillerson the russian order of friendship the countrys highest honor for foreigners after a request by mr sechin according to a person familiar with the matter by late 2014 when the partners hit oil and gas in the arctic sanctions by the us and other countries were in place barring companies from sending oil and gas exploration technology to russia bringing operations to a halt in washington exxon lobbied against the sanctions mr tillerson and others told senior officials that because of the complexity of the arctic project exxon couldnt immediately pull out without significant safety and environmental risks the ceo also said us sanctions applied to an existing project unlike european sanctions which exempted developments already under way people familiar with the matter said exxon withdrew from its arctic project and mr tillerson stayed home from a st petersburg economic summit in 2014 for the first time in years he continued to attend to russia business including efforts to build a gas export plant at sakhalin and other operations over the years i think we have earned each others respect mr tillerson told students at an event in march 2015 at texas tech university when exxon says yes he told them the russians would know that the company would follow through on that yes your commitment means something and so i think its the most important attribute 
tillersons deal style unbending theatrical  senate to weigh if exxon experience especially in russia is qualification for secretary of state moscow  in the spring of 2014 after the us punished russia with sanctions for seizing ukrainian territory rex tillerson made a major decision the exxon mobil corp chief executive now donald trumps nominee for secretary of state would deepen his companys longstanding partnership with the kremlin during negotiations the ceo of rosneft the kremlins statecontrolled oil company looked over a proposed contract related to the pairs operations off sakhalin island in russias far east and scowled said a person with knowledge of the meeting exxon he said put language in the contract he didnt expect he looked at mr tillerson and tore it up mr tillerson the person said leaned back put his hands together smiled silently  and waited with billions of dollars already invested the russians had few other options rosnefts ceo a former intelligence officer and top putin ally named igor sechin eventually backed down and an agreement was struck a look at mr tillersons negotiating style honed over years at the head of one of the worlds largest oil companies shows an executive determined to hold the course even when the landscape shifts dramatically personal relationships were often a deciding factor so were deliberately theatrical tactics such as preplanned temper tantrums and silent stareoffs the question for the senate which is expected to consider mr tillersons nomination on wednesday is to what extent this kind of expertise prepares him for the job of secretary of state he has vast experience hammering out multibilliondollar deals that potentially span decades with government leaders of all stripes on the other hand a company is not a country the former exxon chiefs dealings with rosneft are likely to be a major line of questioning from both republicans and democrats many of whom have said they are uncomfortable with mr tillersons close ties there in the wake of russias alleged hacking attack on figures in the democratic party the russia deals added hundreds of millions of dollars to exxons bottom line and billions of barrels of potential reserves to bolster the companys future production at the same time they ran afoul of state department priorities at a time when the us was using sanctions to try to check russian military interventions in ukraine for exxon one of the worlds largest publicly traded oil companies the results of the russia deals are mixed the deals struck in 2014 which technically expanded projects already in operation didnt violate sanctions which targeted the spread of oil and gas technology but other projects especially a vast arctic investment ground to a halt blocking exxons access to rich reserves it hoped would ease its longtime struggle to find new resources this is an industry with very long timelines said alan jeffers an exxon spokesman the current situation prevents us from activities in the area that are sanctioned but we see that as a pause mr tillerson declined to comment mr sechin and rosneft didnt respond to emailed questions mr tillerson who joined exxon in 1975 and became ceo in 2006 specialized in the types of deals that typified the oil industry in the runup to the recent price crash giant agreements sometimes in unstable places that cost billions of dollars to develop and aimed to produce huge volumes of oil and gas over decades he spent hours with the companys negotiating teams preparing for every potential aspect and plotting tactics including the theatrical according to people he worked with in a meeting in yemen in the 1990s he threw a book and stormed out of talks the tantrum was preplanned one person said anger is a strategy not an emotion mr tillerson told colleagues he negotiated deals worth more than the gdp of some countries with officials who had vast power but lacked expertise that meant he dealt with concerns other than money such as a leaders desire for exxon to educate local workers or help a stateowned oil company gain technology he drank tea with tribal leaders and showed off exxon facilities to visiting dignitaries in interactions with russian leaders mr tillerson avoided giving any impression of american superiority especially amid the postcold war tensions of the 1990s in a 2004

exxon vs russia illusions the oil giants rosneft joint venture was a product of the obama reset with former exxon mobil chief rex tillerson to be grilled wednesday on capitol hill lets save the chefs time by knocking down some obvious nonsense exxon is hostage to vladimir putin because exxon needs russias oil at the time of the 2011 agreement in question the russian partners threw around giant numbers for the potential revenues involved these numbers are still thrown around by leftwing groups the website democracynow recently spun a fantasy about how this 500 billion oil exploration partnership lay at the heart of a russian plan to get donald trump elected in fact the deal is tiny by bigoil standards exxon says the sanctions may have cost it 1 billion the partners had originally talked of spending 32 billion these are small numbers in relation to exxons 240 billion in annual revenues and 360 billion market cap exxon pursued russia in defiance of us national interests actually the deal was a fruit of the obama reset president obama with an exxon executive in tow dropped in on a moscow business conference during his july 2009 summit with mr putin twenty months later joe biden highlighted the resulting deal in his own speech at moscow state university the oil daily headlined its story white house gives blessing to alliance between exxon rosneft exxon opposed sanctions over crimea sure it did but the company knows force majeure when it sees it and notice something else carrot begets stick of all the sanctions levied after mr putins crimea grab biting hardest were those that froze russian access to exxons shale and arctic knowhow mr tillerson is not only a friend but an unabashed admirer of vladimir putin according to abc newss brian ross uh huh a friend in mr putins world is somebody ripe to be thrown to the wolves when it suits mr putins interests and who would probably sever mr putins spine if he could get away with it and mr tillerson is perhaps the one to be admired including by mr putin for the way he fought off gazproms attempt to seize the benefits of the firms 20yearold sakhalin project which still constitutes most of exxons modest stake in russian oil mr putin intervenes in such fights hesitantly warily according to his everchanging calculations of selfpreservation witness his flipflopping over rosnefts recent takeover of bashneft which he opposed and then supported at the same time he knows that shakedowns of the sort that befell bp and shell amid the predatory scramble of russian elites for control of resources are a continuing danger to his regime and its allimportant oil revenues exxon stands out even among oil giants in its steadfast refusal to invest in renewable energy    a strategy of maximizing immediate earnings at the price of future generations ability to live on the planet writes   masha gessen in the new york review of books when senators arent bashing mr tillerson over russia they are likely to bash him over climate change but several common mistakes are illustrated in this indictment it makes no sense for a company whose expertise is oil geology to invest in wind or solar very different skill sets oil companies do so only for pr reasonsso they can decorate their annual reports with windmills and solar panels meanwhile the easiest way to maximize immediate earnings is by not investing at all exxon has done a lot of this returning half its prodigious earnings to shareholders over the past decade in the form of dividends and share buybacks both left and right have dubbed exxon a hypocrite for its lukewarm endorsement of a carbon tax in fact in its typically boyscouty way exxon said as long as were having a debate let it be a serious oneand pointed out the ways a carbon tax is superior to cap and trade and exxon continues to confound critics on both sides by talking about climate change as a risk and equally accurately a risk that climate science has done far less to elucidate than common rhetoric suggests russia though is likely to dominate wednesdays hearing watch to see if a senator tries to make mr tillerson accuse mr putin of the many crimes the us government declines to accuse him ofthe murders of anna politkovskaya and boris nemtsov the 1999 russian apartmentbuilding bombings etc david satter in his own piece   in todays journal hopes us policy makers will use the opportunity to acknowledge the true nature of the putin regime dont bet on it as chess champion garry kasparov explained in his putin book two years ago if they admitted the truth they would have to act and nobody wants to act russian politics is a tough and dangerous business but somebodys got to do itthats been americas bottom line on mr putin mr tillersons success as our next secretary of state is not guaranteedsuccess is hard even to define in todays complex world but at least americans would be getting somebody with a record of succeeding in difficult assignments 
rex tillerson may make unusual tax argument trump nominee wants to spread out taxes on his retirement package from exxon mobil rex tillerson presidentelect donald trumps pick as secretary of state aims to use an unusual interpretation of us tax law to spread out taxes owed on his retirement package over the next decade instead of paying more than 70 million immediately that deferral could save mr tillerson more than 10 million if mr trump and congressional republicans follow through on their plans to cut individual tax rates mr tillerson 64 whose confirmation hearing is scheduled for wednesday was owed roughly 170 million when he left exxon mobil corp in december but now the company and its former chief executive are breaking financial ties   exxon plans to put the cash owed to mr tillerson into a trust that will pay him on the same deferredcompensation schedule on which the restrictions on his exxon holdings were slated to lift normally the creation of such a trust for mr tillersons benefit outside exxon would create immediate taxable income on the full 170 million but the trust for mr tillerson is designed to match the economic and tax treatment he would have gotten had he retired from exxon as scheduled in march with payments and taxes spread over a decade according to exxon and a person familiar with mr tillersons thinking to defer tax payments on the package mr tillerson must argue there is a substantial risk he will never collect the money forfeited payments would go to charity according to the terms of the trust his claim will hinge on an argument that mr tillerson himself could end up violating a noncompete agreement in the trust agreement and forfeit what has been set aside for him the sources said the transition team representing mr tillerson declined to comment robert jackson director of the program on corporate law and policy at columbia law school described the tax strategy as one of the most aggressive and least successful tax positions executives have taken over the past two decades if mr tillersons position survives any scrutiny from the internal revenue service then he may benefit from the republicans proposed revision in the tax code to lower individual top tax rate to 33 from 396 and medicare tax to 29 from 38 mr tillerson and exxon faced several challenges working out his separation exxon sought to preserve as much of its existing longterm compensation agreement with mr tillerson as possible which involved deferring pay for up to a decade they also needed to delink those future payments from the value of exxon stock so that mr tillerson wouldnt have a conflict of interest while at the state department mr tillersons tax deferrals go beyond the normal practice for corporate executives entering government service normally executives can sell shares and reinvest in cash treasurys or some mutual funds while deferring capitalgains taxes they would otherwise owe mr tillerson can do that with exxon stock he already holds without restrictions but most of his exxon holdings are in restricted stock and restricted stock units that are scheduled to be fully available to him over the next decade the question of whether mr tillerson must pay taxes now turns primarily on whether there is a substantial risk that he may forfeit some of the payments from the trust irs rules under section 83 of the tax code say noncompete clauses themselves generally dont amount to a substantial risk of forfeiture said thomas cryan a lawyer at buchanan ingersoll rooney pc in washington but the rules also say that presumption can be overcome by looking at the persons age skills the availability and likelihood of other employment and the employers likelihood of enforcing the clause factors that could work in mr tillersons favor the former exxon executive might become more valuable to oilandgas companies after being secretary of state leading him back into the industry and in violation of his noncompete he might also have opportunities outside the industry that would lower the risk of triggering the noncompete clause including paid speeches and service on corporate boards hes going to be much sought after said gregg polsky a tax law professor at the university of georgia he called exxons argument that the taxes can be deferred aggressive but not frivolous bradley olson contributed to this article write to richard rubin at  richardrubinwsjcom 
exxon active in sanctions debates but rex tillerson denies lobbying testimony may reflect view that public comments and private efforts dont constitute a formal effort to lobby against certain sanctions washingtonoil giant exxon mobil corp has a long history of advocacy and engagement around issues related to international sanctions including membership in a washingtonbased trade group that strongly opposes unilateral us sanctions against foreign countries and entities yet rex tillerson the former ceo of exxon mobil argued forcefully wednesday that neither he nor his former company ever lobbied against us sanctions on russia   or iran a statement that a number of senators aggressively questioned in a marathon day of confirmation hearings   over his appointment to serve in the incoming administration of presidentelect donald trump as secretary of state i never lobbied against the sanctions to my knowledge exxon mobil never lobbied against the sanctions exxon mobil participated in understanding how the sanctions were going to be constructed and was asked and provided information regarding how those might impact american business interest mr tillerson said to the committee in a hearing that lasted most of wednesday his testimony may reflect his interpretation that public comments in opposition to certain sanctions and private efforts to weaken or scale them back dont constitute a formal effort to lobby against them however his company and its outside consultants have filed more than 30 lobbying disclosure reports listing sanctions issues in iran russia and libya as among its issues those reports didnt specify whether exxon supported or opposed the various sanctions effortsbut the company in financial disclosures and public statements by executives like mr tillerson have indicated that sanctions often hurt the companys business interests in addition the company is a duespaying member of usaengage a corporatefunded advocacy group that opposes us sanctions and has called on lawmakers to reject unilateral efforts aimed at punishing iran russia myanmar and cuba among others at issue is a policy question about the use of sanctions a major tool of us diplomacy that gives the executive branch the ability to deter compel or punish states foreign individuals and groups in wednesdays hearing mr tillerson expressed concerns about the idea of sanctions which he says can sometimes punish us businesses its important to acknowledge that when sanctions are imposed they by their design are going to harm american business thats the ideaits to disrupt americas business engagement in whatever countrys being targeted for sanctions he said exxon spent 88 million on lobbying the federal government in the first three quarters of 2016 making it the top lobbyist in the oilandgas industry according to a center for responsive politics analysis of the most recent disclosures exxon has spent years lobbying the state department on trade and energy issues including us relations with russia in 2014 the company lobbied the department over congressional legislation on sanctions against russia according to federal lobbying disclosures the bill wasnt approved by congress the company also sought to have some of its continuing projects exempted from sanctions a request that would have mirrored european restrictions on business in russia after the country seized ukrainian territory in 2014 the obama administration denied the request and exxon had to withdraw from some operations in the country according to people familiar with the matter exxon sought permission for an extension to finish drilling a well because of safety concerns a request that was granted once exxon exited russia announced that the well was a nearbillionbarreldiscovery exxon has said its losses due to sanctions would amount to 1 billion but the company sees some of its work in russia   such as in the arctic as on pause because of the restrictions a spokeswoman for usaengage confirmed that exxon is a member of the advocacy group which is part of the national foreign trade councila profree trade industry group funded by major corporations the group doesnt oppose all sanctions and has backed sanctions in conjunction with other international partnersin part to ensure that us businesses arent restricted while foreign companies remain free to do business with the targets of the sanction exxon mobil regularly engages with lawmakers and others to discuss the potential impact of sanctions and to express our view that sanctions should treat american companies fairly we do not express an opinion as to whether or not sanctions should be imposed that is a decision for policy makers said a spokesman for the company in washington corporations routinely channel their more controversial lobbying practices through trade associations to give themselves plausible deniability said lisa gilbert director of public citizens congress watch division the practice gives them the ability to say one thing in their mission statements or to their shareholders and straightforwardly support the policies out the other side of their mouths ms gilbert said write to byron tau

marco rubios vote is key for secretary of state nominee florida senator hasnt decided whether to back former exxon ceo rex tillerson washingtonrepublican sen marco rubio has become the central figure in the senate confirmation drama over presidentelect donald trumps choice to lead the state department emerging as the key vote on confirming rex tillerson to the nations top diplomatic post a trio of republican senators have expressed deep reservations about mr tillerson the former exxon mobil corp chief executive in addition to mr rubio of florida they are sens john mccain of arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina the three have raised concerns about mr tillersons personal and business relationships with senior figures in the russian government an especially sensitive topic due to the us intelligence assessment that the kremlin interfered with the nations presidential election all three remain undecided on whether to support mr tillerson after a marathon eighthour hearing with the former ceo on capitol hill this week but no senator is more critical to mr tillersons fate than mr rubio who sits on the foreign relations committee which will vote on whether to support the nomination republicans have a onevote advantage on the panel meaning that mr rubio may be crucial to moving mr tillersons nomination to the floor with a recommendation that he be confirmed for the job mr rubio has remained tightlipped about his intentions he has said he has additional questions for mr tillerson as part of the vetting process and would withhold comment until he has come to a decision were just going to continue to go through the process and well make a decision soon said mr rubio on capitol hill this week after the confirmation hearing a committee vote on mr tillersons nomination could come as soon as next week messrs graham and mccain also say that they are withholding judgment but that they are concerned about mr tillersons views on russia and the broader direction of the trump administrations proposed detente with moscow mr trump has proposed improving relations with russian president vladimir putin a stance that is at odds with many republicans in congress in a television appearance this week mr graham said the tillerson nomination was salvageable with the potential to win his vote i just still havent made up my mind mr mccain told reporters the senator has said he is concerned about mr tillersons relationships with senior members of the russian government mr rubio subjected mr tillerson to several rounds of withering questioning with a special focus on the issue of russia economic sanctions and human rights in one exchange mr rubio asked whether mr putin was a war criminal citing the russian militarys actions in syria as the reason for the question mr tillerson demurred saying those are very very serious charges to make and i would want to have much more information before reaching a conclusion there is enormous pressure within the senate republican caucus to start the trump administration with a series of smooth confirmation hearings and votes but republicans have a thin margin for error holding 52 out of 100 seats in the senate gop leaders have signaled that the confirmation of mr tillerson as well as all of mr trumps other nominees is a top priority no cabinet nominee has been rejected by the senate since 1989 though several have withdrawn mr rubios willingness to withhold his support comes is an indication that he has more room for political independence i think in his view hes doing what the senate is supposed to doto provide advice and consent on presidential nominees said ryan williams a republican strategist who expects mr tillerson to be ultimately confirmed hes just been reelected with six years in front of him in the senate said mr williams i think he feels liberated to approach decisions in his second term without the same political considerations hes liberated to do what he thinks is the right thing without having to think about running for president or for reelection many democrats have spoken out about their concerns about mr tillerson though it is possible he will draw some democratic support in the final vote tally he could also win democratic support in the committee offsetting the potential loss of mr rubios vote i will oppose the nomination of rex tillerson as secretary of state he has a notable record of business success and a laudable commitment to civic affairs but he did not demonstrate the awareness judgment or independence i expect from our nations chief diplomat said sen tim kaine d va who also sits on the foreign relations panel a committee decision not to approve mr tillerson wouldnt block his nomination from moving to the senate floor though such a development is rare another possible pathway is that senate republican leadership could bypass the committee entirely and bring mr tillerson directly to the flooranother extremely rare procedural maneuver that nevertheless remains available to senate leadership read more on capital journal capital journal   is wsjcoms home for politics policy and national security news  us ends

exxon profit tumbles on charge revenue rises oil giant posts first increase in revenue after nine quarters of declines accounting probe looms exxon mobil corp said tuesday it wrote down the value of

development that had become fairly routine for peers as prices crashed in recent years since 2014 other us companies have slashed the value of their assets by more than 200 billion according to s global market intelligence the impairment appears a bit light given the companys resources said brian youngberg an energy analyst with edward jones in st louis exxon shares fell 11 to 8389 on tuesday while peers such as royal dutch shell plc either rose or held roughly flat exxon wrote down naturalgas assets in the rocky mountains the company purchased shale producer xto energy for 31 billion in 2010 during the heart of a drilling boom that would send naturalgas prices careening downward within a few years the price which averaged 535 per million british thermal units when the deal was announced late in 2009 is now about 323 the sec investigation initially sprung out of a separate examination begun in late 2015 by new york attorney general eric schneiderman into exxons history of advocacy about global warming and how the company has communicated with its investors on the matter exxon which has denied wrongdoing and characterized that probe as politically motivated submitted more than one million pages of documents to the new york democrat most of which have been shared with the sec according to people familiar with the matter exxon hadnt booked a decline in the value of its assets since at least 1990 this is due in part to the companys practice of being more conservative when initially recognizing the value of new oil and gas that it discovers according to analysts and people familiar with its accounting it is also related to a management view that it is better to place a high burden on executives to ensure that projects can work at lower prices than to write down their value the companys senior leaders wanted to avoid writedowns because in accounting terms they have the effect of making the companys investments appear more profitable according to people familiar with exxons practices we dont do writedowns former chief executive rex tillerson told trade publication energy intelligence in 2015 we are not going to bail you out by writing it down that is

revenue increased for the first time in more than two years rising 2 to 61 billion debt levels surged to the highest point in company history at the end of last year as exxons operations failed to generate enough cash to pay for new investments and dividends although exxon carries relatively low debt relative to its size the increase in borrowing prompted standard poors last year to strip the company of the perfect triplea credit rating it had held since the great depression exxon also signaled tuesday that it is likely to recognize that as much as 46 billion barrels of its reserves predominantly in canadas oil sands arent profitable to produce according to sec rules the reserve losses might be offset somewhat by the companys new finds last year jeff woodbury exxons vice president of investor relations told analysts tuesday those figures would be finalized and released in the coming weeks he said although exxon might no longer qualify those reserves as proved based on sec rules mr woodbury said the company wouldnt alter its operations or change how it manages those assets there are separate processes and rules that govern how oilandgas companies book reserves to assure investors that they are finding new sources of future production and how they value them on company financial statements the sec requires companies to evaluate their future prospects based on the average price of the previous year in this case about 43 a barrel that is a 15 drop from 2015 recognizing how much those reserves are worth is separately overseen by the financial accounting standards board an independent group that sets accounting standards for us public companies as oil and gas producers spend money drilling new wells those expenses can be capitalized as an asset but when expected future cash flow from the reserves is no longer greater than their socalled carrying value which relates to the amount that was capitalized the rules indicate that a writedown is needed thus while the canadian reserve losses didnt result in a writedown immediately there is still a chance that could happen next year according to the accounting rules such a determination would depend in part on exxons view of future prices in coming decades last year the company reduced its reserves by the equivalent of more than 800 million barrels most of which stemmed from us naturalgas assets the 2 billion impairment this year was also tied to us naturalgas wells imperial oil an exxoncontrolled company that operates in canada reported that its oilproduction business posted a profit of

oil companies take to thrifty bets energy producers like exxon and bp are avoiding expensive engineering forays in favor of cheaper quicker projects the worlds biggest oil companies are getting thrifty oil prices have made a modest comeback from the lows hit a little over a year ago but energy companies such as exxon mobil corp and bp plc arent pursuing the extravagant bets they made at 100 a barrellike commissioning multibilliondollar projects in arctic waters and kazakhstans caspian sea these companies including exxon bp royal dutch shell plc and chevron corp are putting their money into cheaper quicker ventures in texas shale country the middle east and brazil and squeezing more from existing projects worldwide exxon last week unveiled an ambitious plan  to put its us drilling opportunities in texas new mexico and north dakota at the heart of its future by 2025 the company said its production from these areas could more than triple to the equivalent of 750000 barrels a day together with other shale production that would amount to about a third of exxons current output it is a shift away from the business model longemployed by the worlds largest oil companies favoring technologically challenging projects that had huge upfront costs that would be paid off over 20 or 30 years to drive down costs big oil companies are abandoning such developments in favor of standardization and bolton models that take advantage of existing infrastructure they are returning to old basins to see what they can extract with new technologies and focusing on the lowestcost prospects the appeal of cheaper projects that can bring oil or gas to market within a few years is that it allows big companies to avoid being locked in to multibillion investments over as much as a decade said ryan lance the chief executive of conocophillips at the annual ceraweek conference in houston on tuesday theyre not just paying lip service to this said luke parker vice president of corporate analysis at wood mackenzie a scottish energy consultancy they want to be in a position to future proof themselves against peak oil demand when it comes the challenge of the strategy is that many of the big western companies have yet to prove that they can consistently turn a profit in a time of lower prices especially in us shale fields increasing production may prove even more daunting since the companies have to spend billions just to replace the barrels they pump every year last week bp announced plans to drive down its breakeven oil price to between 35 and 40 a barrel by 2021 all while increasing production it is a feat the british oil giant says it can pull off by maintaining strict cash discipline driving down costs and focusing on projects that generate strong returns even at current prices bp recently abandoned ambitious plans to explore in the great australian bighta potentially huge source of new supply that still couldnt compete economically with other project opportunities instead it invested 2 billion for a 10 stake in oil fields in the united arab emirates which has some of the worlds lowest oilextraction costs going forward the company is focusing on longlived cash bricks of low cost oil and natural gas said bp chief executive bob dudley during an interview at ceraweek others are pursuing a similar agenda chevron ceo john watson told analysts tuesday that the company intends to invest more of its capital budget in projects that start up quickly and generate higher returns about threefourths of the companys 20 billion capital budget in 2017 will generate cash within two years mr watson said shell is focusing the bulk of its new investment on deep water projects offshore brazil that it says break even at less than 40 a barrel frances total sa says reducing the breakeven level on its projects is a top priority last week italys eni spa said new projects out to 2020 will have an average breakeven of 30 a barrel the focus on frugality is a departure from the 10year period from 2005 to 2014 when concerns that supply could run out and soaring oil prices sent energy companies on a grand often wildly expensive chase for new production they took on projects like kashagan a giant oil field in kazakhstan that took exxon shell and others over a decade and 50 billion to develop it will produce oil for decades but has become a cautionary tale especially after oil prices began falling in 2014 according to sanford c bernstein europes biggest oil companies have slashed capital budgets by 51 billion since their 2013 peak and are expected to keep spending at current levels of around 90 billion a year through to 2020 but production volumes are on the rise a similar pattern also is emerging at exxon and chevron both of which have roughly halved spending since 2013 but production is still seen increasing according to estimates from s global market intelligence fatih birol executive director of the international energy agency in paris warned monday that shorter cycle investment plans could create an oil price shock the iea estimates oil and gas investment  dropped to 450 billion annually during the twoyear energy downturn 25 less than it needs to be to meet future global demand growth and offset declines in existing fields mr birol said investments globally need to rise at least 20 to avoid oil price spikes in the coming years another challenge for these companies will be to prove that they can pivot successfully even as exxon plans to boost its us focusincluding with a 20 billion spending plan  on american refinery and processing operationsthe company lost 42 billion in its american oilandgas drilling business last year and more than 500 million in 2015 while many of the companies are moving ahead with investments

the new exxon fewer risks lower returns exxons gulf coast investment says more about the changed company than it does about new us spending what would iron ass say exxon mobil corp got praise from the president  for its 20 billion commitment to projects on the gulf coast  the real news was what the investment says about exxon and other big oil companies also the plans had been years in the making and account for only a fraction of the 300 billion or so the company will probably invest over the same time for longtime observers the announcement is another sign that the company shaped by lee iron ass raymond is changing as is the industry the predecessor to recently departed ceo rex tillerson now secretary of state mr raymond is best remembered for roughly quintupling shareholders money in the 12 years ended in 2005 his biggest contribution to exxon though was a relentless focus on return on capital employed this had two effects it gave exxon the financial discipline to zig when others were zagging in a boomandbust industry earning it superior returns across the cycle it also along with exxons size allowed it to make some very big very profitable bets spending 20 billion in oil gas and chemical infrastructure or plowing 65 billion into doubling acreage in the permian basins shale fields in january seems like more of the same it isnt shale may be the future but it is problematic for big oil small competitors that could never risk billions and spend years extracting oil and gas from a field with high political geological or technological risks regularly roll the dice on a few wells in a place like the permian the competition lowers exxons potential return despite its superior technology and management though it also lowers risk because it can easily scale back investment during periods of weak demand chemical midstream refining and transport infrastructure of the sort exxon is building along the gulf coast on the other hand isnt for the commitmentshy yet these longlived assets essential components of an integrated oilandgas company have historically offered poorer returns across the cycle from the years 2000 through 2011 for example downstream and chemicals earned exxon a return on average capital employed of 205 and 197 respectively that is emblematic of mr raymonds high bar for returns but far short of the 334 earned over the same period by upstream oil and gas there is good reason for the higher bar the latter could turn up less oil than expected get expropriated by a foreign government or fetch a lower price than projected in the past five years though the returns have flipped with oilandgas production earning less than 12 underperforming the rest of the business that may improve as oil emerges from a bear market but not by much we may be in a new normal for big oil get financial insights and commentary on global investing from the wall street journals heard on the street team subscribe to the podcast

business news oil firms now favor frugal bets  exxon bp and other energy companies are avoiding expensive engineering projects the worlds biggest oil companies are getting thrifty oil prices have made a modest comeback from the lows hit a little over a year ago but energy companies such as exxon mobil corp and bp plc arent pursuing the extravagant bets they made at 100 a barrel  like commissioning multibilliondollar projects in arctic waters and kazakhstans caspian sea these companies including royal dutch shell plc and chevron corp are putting their money into cheaper quicker ventures in texas shale country the middle east and brazil and squeezing more from existing projects worldwide exxon last week unveiled an ambitious plan to put its us drilling opportunities in texas new mexico and north dakota at the heart of its future by 2025 the company said its production from these areas could more than triple to the equivalent of 750000 barrels a day together with other shale production that would amount to about a third of exxons current output it is a shift away from the business model long employed by the worlds largest oil companies favoring challenging projects that had huge upfront costs that would be paid off over 20 or 30 years to drive down costs big oil companies are abandoning such developments in favor of standardization and bolton models that take advantage of existing infrastructure they are returning to old basins to see what they can extract with new technologies and focusing on the lowestcost prospects the appeal of cheaper projects that can bring oil or gas to market within a few years is that it allows big companies to avoid being locked in to multibillion investments over as much as a decade said ryan lance the chief executive of conocophillips at the annual ceraweek conference in houston on tuesday theyre not just paying lip service to this said luke parker vice president of corporate analysis at wood mackenzie a scottish energy consulting firm they want to be in a position to future proof themselves against peak oil demand when it comes the challenge of the strategy is that many of the big western companies have yet to prove that they can consistently turn a profit in a time of lower prices especially in us shale fields increasing production may prove even more daunting because the companies have to spend billions just to replace the barrels they pump every year last week bp announced plans to drive down its breakeven oil price to between 35 and 40 a barrel by 2021 all while increasing production it is a feat the british oil giant says it can pull off by maintaining strict cash discipline driving down costs and focusing on projects that generate strong returns even at current prices bp recently abandoned ambitious plans to explore in the great australian bight  a potentially huge source of new supply that still couldnt compete economically with other project opportunities instead it invested 2 billion for a 10 stake in oil fields in the united arab emirates which has some of the worlds lowest oilextraction costs going forward the company is focusing on longlived cash bricks of low cost oil and natural gas said bp chief executive bob dudley during an interview at ceraweek others are pursuing a similar agenda chevron ceo john watson told analysts tuesday that the company intends to invest more of its capital budget in projects that start up quickly and generate higher returns about threefourths of the companys 20 billion capital budget in 2017 will generate cash within two years mr watson said shell is focusing the bulk of its new investment on deep water projects offshore brazil that it says break even at less than 40 a barrel frances total sa says reducing the breakeven level on its projects is a top priority according to sanford c bernstein europes biggest oil companies have slashed capital budgets by 51 billion since their 2013 peak and are expected to keep spending at current levels of around 90 billion a year through 2020 but production volumes are on the rise enlarge this image 
rex tillerson used email alias at exxon to discuss climate change new york says attorney generals office accuses exxon of withholding documents in probe into what it told investors about climate change says rex tillerson used pseudonym wayne tracker the new york attorney general accused exxon mobil corp monday of withholding documents from his office as it investigates whether the energy company misrepresented its understanding of climate change to investors and the public lawyers for attorney general eric schneidermans office said in court documents that exxon hadnt disclosed that rex tillerson the former chairman and chief executive used an alias email address to discuss riskmanagement issues related to climate change mr tillerson now the us secretary of state used the pseudonym wayne tracker from at least 2008 to 2015 according to the attorney general despite the companys incidental production of approximately 60 documents bearing the wayne tracker email address neither exxon nor its counsel have ever disclosed that this separate email account was a vehicle for mr tillersons relevant communications at exxon senior enforcement counsel john oleske said in a letter to new york supreme court justice barry ostrager exxon said in a statement it has provided more than 25 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from mr schneidermans office and will respond to the claims in court the company acknowledged that waynetrackerexxonmobilcom address is part of the companys email system it was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of businessrelated topics the company said but reports indicating that emails to or from this address were exclusively climaterelated are false a spokesman for mr schneidermans office declined to comment a state department spokeswoman declined to comment mr oleske said in the letter monday that despite promising to move heaven and earth to comply with a subpoena exxon had withheld documents related to senior management including from 34 email accounts assigned to top executives board members and their assistants the new york attorney general and the us securities and exchange commission are also investigating how exxon values its assets in a world of increasing climatechange regulations a probe that could have farreaching consequences for the oil and gas industry the irving texasbased company has played down questions about its modest asset writedowns saying it is extremely conservative in booking the value of new fields and wells in january exxon said it wrote down the value of more than 2 billion in us assets departing from decadeslong practice it is unclear at this stage what impact the investigations may have on exxon if any mr schneiderman has broad powers to investigate corporations under new york states martin act including civil and criminal claims against companies for securities violations 
exxon rejects new yorks accusations in climate case oil major acknowledges more of tillersons emails could emerge because of technical issue with his alias account exxon mobil corp called accusations that it withheld documents relating to climate change from the new york attorney general an attempt to discredit the energy company but disclosed a newly discovered technical issue that could mean it will soon release more of its former chairmans emails attorney general eric schneidermans office has been investigating whether exxon misrepresented its understanding of climate change to investors and the public earlier this week lawyers for mr schneidermans office said in court documents that exxon had not disclosed that rex tillerson exxons former chief executive had used an alias emailwaynetrackerexxonmobilcom to discuss the issue exxon rebutted that claim in a letter to the court on thursday saying that the accusations were about obtaining publicity not information the company has produced more than 25 million pages of documents in connection with mr schneidermans investigation including emails from the wayne tracker account  as well as the primary exxon email address used by mr tillerson who is now us secretary of state mr tillersons use of the wayne tracker account was entirely proper exxon said in its letter it allowed a limited group of senior executives to send timesensitive messages to mr tillerson that received priority over the normal daily traffic that crossed the desk of a busy ceo the purpose was efficiency not secrecy but a reexamination of mr tillersons wayne tracker accountprompted by mr schneidermans accusationsrevealed a technical issue with the system exxon uses to protect and save emails that are under a litigation hold the company said despite the companys intent to preserve the relevant emails in both of mr tillersons accounts due to the manner in which email accounts had been configured years earlier and how they interact with the system these technological processes did not automatically extend to the secondary email account exxon said in the letter to the court that means more emails associated with the wayne tracker email address could surface and be released to the ags office but because many of the emails sent to the wayne tracker account were also sent to mr tillersons primary email or were sent from senior executives whose communications fall under mr schneidermans subpoena exxon said it expects the impact of the technical issue will not be significant mr schneidermans office has known about the alias email account since february 2016 the company said a spokeswoman for the attorney general said he looked forward to addressing the issues raised in exxons letter in court more than 16 months after receiving our subpoena exxon is just now admitting it may not have preserved or produced the emails of its former ceo who used an alias email account said amy spitalnick press secretary for mr schneiderman mr tillerson has been traveling in asia  this week the state department declined comment 
exxon harnesses computing power a supercomputing record claimed earlier this year by exxon mobil corp is about more than bragging rights the energy giant says the computational power could revolutionize the way that it models and predicts production over the life of an oil or gas field exxon conducted the recordbreaking feat last month with the national center for supercomputing applications blue waters supercomputer running a reservoir simulation using 716800 processors that is more than four times the number of processors previously used in the oilandgas industry on such simulations according to staff at the ncsa using more than 700000 processors is similar to harnessing the power of 22400 computers with 32 processors per computer its orders of magnitude faster than what we could do previously which is allowing us to optimize our oil and gas field development plans said carol lloyd engineering vice president of exxon mobil upstream research which is the research arm tied to the exploration development and production of oil and gas a single such reservoir model traditionally takes days to produce results ms lloyd said with this reservoir simulation breakthrough the simulation can be done in a few minutes or hours she said for years energy companies such as exxon have used supercomputers to analyze seismic data and assemble a map of geologic formations which can shape decisions about where to drill creating a model that predicts production of a reservoir over time is more complicated and exxon said its latest supercomputing effort in this area has yielded faster and more detailed modeling new approaches to supercomputing made that possible in a highly competitive and capitalintensive industry in which prices fluctuate constantly crisper and more detailed images and better predictions with less guesswork and the least environmental impact are critical to the business according to ms lloyd and energy analysts she called the latest computational feat a breakthrough in the past five years oilandgas companies have begun to explore using highcost supercomputing technology for more complex problems such as reservoir simulations said jan e odegard executive director at the ken kennedy institute for information technology at rice university reservoir simulations are computer models that simulate how geological rock and fluid will behave over time as an oil or gas field is drilled the models are based on massive amounts of seismic data historical production data and other information and are used to design and develop the most efficient strategies to maximize the recovery of oil and gas reservoir simulations are far more complex than seismic imaging to scale across many computer processors because they require the computers to constantly share and exchange data in a way that seismic imaging doesnt in traditional seismic imaging the algorithms used permit each computer to work independently of each other on a small part of the problem without needing to communicate constantly mr odegard said this constant communication between different computational elements is part of a technique called parallelism which is at the heart of exxons supercomputing feat parallelism refers to the ability to split a specific computer problem to perform evenly across many computational elements such as computer cores which process the information supercomputing experts say parallelism in highperformance computing is similar to distributed computing used in data storage and analytic frameworks such as hadoop in both parallel and distributed computing computational components located on networked computers coordinate actions by communicating with one another parallelism is more complex because it requires tighter coordination and frequent communication in the exchanging of data between the elements mr odegard said its like managing a symphony orchestra where everything has to be carefully coordinated said dr bill gropp director of the national center for supercomputing applications exxon initiated the supercomputing project with the ncsa in june 2015 and is the only oilandgas company to work with the organization

oil companies modest prize breaking even exxon shell chevron and bp barely cover spending dividends with cash the worlds biggest oil companies are struggling just to break even despite billions of dollars in spending cuts and a modest oilprice rebound exxon mobil corp royal dutch shell plc chevron corp and bp plc didnt make enough money in 2016 to cover their costs according to a wall street journal analysis to calculate each companies free cash flowthe excess cash remaining after coststhe journal deducted the firms dividends and capital expenditures from its cash from operations all four firms fell short of cash flow for the year although exxon said it broke even by its own metrics which exclude dividends the analysis also showed that the four companies ended last year with more debt than they began it the firms are showing signs of improvement for example shell and exxon notched stronger quarters late last year however analysts point to challenges ahead as oil prices hover around 50 a barrel bp says it will need oil at 60 a barrel  to balance cash generation against capital expenditures and dividends while chevron is targeting 50 a barrel with the help of asset sales investment bank jefferies estimates neither shell nor exxon require more than 50 a barrel though those companies dont disclose breakeven prices for companies once known as profit machineswhose executives were hauled before congress in 2005 to explain their enormous earningstheir cash problems demonstrate just how unprepared they were for a historic crash and tepid recovery in oil prices they have maintained the same large dividends they had when oil prices were over 100 a barrel piling on debt and selling off assets to prioritize shareholders above all else the result is that spending on dividends and capital investments has ballooned above cash generated from their businesses the issue has worried investors who expect those steady dividends because oil giants dont have the capacity to grow much exxon shell and their competitors are under pressure to show they can drum up cash to keep shelling out dividends since the oil price collapsed its been all about whos fastest down the road to breaking even said iain reid a senior analyst at macquarie capital in the short term its all about cash flow because people are still worried about the dividend exxon shell and their peers spent much of the past three years scrambling to reassure investors that their dividends were safe amid the oilprice crash these companies were already struggling to live within their means at elevated oil prices in response to the tumble in prices the companies laid off thousands of workers slashed billions in spending and piled on debt to protect the payouts despite disappointing profits last year they say that medicine is now working both exxon and shell managed to break even in the final quarter last year in the fourth quarter exxon generated 400 million more than it spent and shell made 12 billion over its outlays according to the journals analysis however for the full year exxon spent nearly 7 billion more on developing new projects and dividends in 2016 than it generated in cash shells costs last year were around 11 billion above its cash generation the journals analysis shows we are right in the middle of transforming the company shell chief executive ben van beurden told the ceraweek conference in houston in march we are going to be able to produce a free cash flow that is going to be more than twice as high as it was in the 90 era but this time in a 60 world in a sign that investors remain fixated on companies cash flow position bps share price tumbled around 4 when the company upgraded its breakeven oil price to 60 a barrel in february international benchmark brent crude hasnt hit that level since the middle of 2015 the ultimate goal of the company is to generate excess free cash flow bp chief executive bob dudley said in a march interview in houston the company has seven new projects starting up this year and nine more under way that will add 800000 barrels a day of new production by the end of the decade pushing up returns bp expects to drive its breakeven price back down toward 55 a barrel by the end of the year from about 60 now the message going forward is good chevron chief executive john watson told analysts in january four years ago i wouldnt have thought that would be the case at moderate prices but all of the companies ability to break even rely on forces outside their control especially oil prices in february investment banks predicted oil prices would average about 57 a barrel this year according to a wall street journal poll analysts said prices could fall short of that mark depending on how quickly us shale producers ramp back up and whether the organization of the petroleum exporting countries can maintain its agreement with other major oil producers to reduce output chevrons 50abarrel breakeven threshold relies in part on support from asset sales shell also is leaning heavily on plans to divest 30 billion of assets by next year to help it bring down its elevated debt levels at the end of last year the four companies combined net debt amounted to 1863 billion this is the year when their credibility will be tested said jefferies analyst jason gammel referring to big oil companies some are more capable than others even exxon the worlds biggest publicly traded oil company is showing rare signs of weakness the company wrote down the value of more than 2 billion in us assets earlier this year and shaved a chunk off its reserves estimates because of securities and exchange commission rules it ended 2016 with net debt totaling 391 billionthe highest debt level in the

exxon eyes brazil expansion oil company in talks to partner with petrobras on offshore oil projects exxon mobil corp the only big oil company without a major foothold in brazil is in talks to gain access to the countrys prized deepwater resources according to people familiar with the matter the talks have included discussions about a joint venture partnership through which exxon would invest in projects with stateoil firm petr leo brasileiro sa or petrobras as well as potentially buying stakes in offshore tracts the brazilian government plans to lease out this year the people said the specific terms of any agreement have yet to be completed one person cautioned that talks between exxon and petrobras remained at a preliminary stage but exxon which has eyed deep water resources in brazil for at least a decade is working with hess corp in seeking to expand in the country after brazil revised its regulations last year to attract greater foreign investment the people said representatives for exxon hess and petrobras declined to comment exxon would join french giant total sa and norwegian statecontrolled statoil asa both of which have formed partnerships with petrobras and expanded in brazil in the past year royal dutch shell plc has said it plans to invest 10 billion in the country over the next five years as part of a push to double its global deep water production  the race to expand in brazil comes as petrobras is selling tens of billions of dollars in assets in a bid to work off the largest debt burden in the global oil industry brazils conservative government in power since the impeachment of former president dilma rousseff last year sees foreign investment in the oil sector as key to an economic recovery after brazils worst recession on record risks abound for the big oil companies petrobras the dominant player in brazil is at the center of an epic corruption scandal and is financially crippled by its 118 billion debt load and while the business environment has improved over the past nine months political analysts say the 2018 presidential election could easily reverse that trend still brazil is one of the most important oil frontiers with as much as 50 billion barrels of recoverable resources some analysts say the country has the opportunity to emerge as the worlds fifthlargest crude producer by 2025 behind only saudi arabia russia the us and iraq everybody wants to get a piece of the pie said kjetil solbraekke senior vice president for south america at consultancy rystad energy these are probably the most prolific highreturning oil assets available in the world exxons interest in a partnership is the latest example of a strategy the company has pursued in recent years to gain access to statecontrolled oil and gas resources to gain entry to certain areas the irving texas company has offered foreign players a chance to diversify their holdings and invest alongside exxon in other projects around the world such a partnership was at the heart of a series of deals between exxon and russia in 2011 and 2012 that were later put on hold due to us sanctions the company has also formed partnerships with qatar where it holds a lucrative concession to produce natural gas to develop gas export projects in the gulf of mexico and in mozambique joining forces with petrobras in a similar fashion on a series of investments may be the only way to build an offshore position in brazil analysts said if you dont have a relationship with a dominant state player such as petrobras in brazil its very difficult to go anywhere said ruaraidh montgomery an analyst at energy consulting firm wood mackenzie an industry bonanza for brazilian resources began more than a decade ago with the discovery by petrobras of the lula field which is believed to hold billions of barrels of oil named after thenbrazilian president luiz in cio lula da silva the field lies below several miles of ocean water and a thick layer of salt that can make drilling risky and expensive emboldened by 100abarrel oil prices the leftleaning government that ruled brazil until last year imposed onerous requirements on the oil industry making petrobras the sole operator of oil projects in the prized subsalt layer on the brazil continental shelf and demanding high levels of locally produced parts and labor brazils notoriously complex costly and often unclear operating environment are among the reasons exxon stayed on the sidelines as other oil majors piled in seeking to woo investors brazils new leaders opened up the subsalt to foreign operators last year and reduced the socalled localcontent requirements in february the country is also likely later this year to auction numerous offshore blocks to companies wishing to drill exploration wells officials said those changes are among the primary reasons exxon is motivated to expand in brazil said people familiar with the companys plans exxon holds an interest in two deepwater blocks off brazils shores including more than 160000 acres and drilled several dry holes in the country more than five years ago with hess petrobras chief executive pedro

exxon seeks us waiver to resume russia oil venture exxon mobil applied to treasury for exemption to resume venture with rosneft forged in 2012 by rex tillerson washingtonexxon mobil corp has applied to the treasury department for a waiver from us sanctions on russia in a bid to resume its joint venture with state oil giant pao rosneft according to people familiar with the matter exxon has been seeking us permission to drill with rosneft in several areas banned by sanctions and renewed a push for approval in march shortly after its most recent chief executive rex tillerson became secretary of state on feb 1 according to one of these people the company originally applied for a waiver to gain access to the black sea in july 2015 but its application wasnt approved the person said the waiver request is likely to be closely scrutinized by members of congress who are seeking to intensify sanctions on russia in response to what the us said was its use of cyberattacks to interfere with elections last year congress has also launched an investigation into whether there were ties between aides to donald trump and russias government during the presidential campaign and the political transition mr tillerson during his time at exxon forged a close working relationship with russian president vladimir putin and with rosneft a company that is critical to russias oilreliant economy the state department is among the us government agencies that have a say on exxons waiver application which was made to the treasury departments office of foreign assets control according to current and former us officials mr tillerson is recusing himself from any matters involving exxon for two years and wont be involved with any decision made by any government agency involving exxon during this period a state department spokesman said before he became secretary of state mr tillerson said exxon opposes sanctions when they arent applied in a uniform way he testified during his confirmation hearings  that neither he nor his former company ever lobbied against us sanctions on russia a spokesman for the treasury department said it doesnt comment on waiver applications an exxon spokesman

employees from the project exxon has disclosed that in 2015 and 2016 the company received a license from the treasury department allowing the company to undertake limited administrative actions in its partnership with rosneft according to company documents such permission would put exxon in a position to move more quickly if it gets the green light to drill according to the person familiar with the matter exxons proposal to drill in the black sea has been circulated in various federal departments in recent months several people said exxon is arguing that it deserves a waiver there because under its deal with rosneft its exploration rights in the black sea will expire if it doesnt act and because some of its top foreign competitors arent similarly restricted it is unusual for a company to seek a waiver based purely on future business prospects according to former us officials american companies often seek waivers from sanctions citing humanitarian trade or operational issues the

there off the coast of romania and holds a license for an area in ukrainian waters although a number of the biggest western oil companies are seeking opportunities in the black sea it remains a frontier area where few deepwater wells have been drilled meaning estimates could change as more work is done according to industry analysts under the terms of its deal with rosneft exxon needs an oil discovery in the black sea by the end of this year to obtain a russian government license to drill unless exxon receives approval soon there might not be enough time to safely drill an exploratory

exxon chevron earnings point to sign of strengthening oil industry gains reflect a rally in oil prices from 2016 lows and revenue from new projects the worlds biggest oil companies are seeing their highest profits in more than a year an early signal that they may be turning a corner on their long path to recovery exxon mobil corp on friday reported its best quarter since 2015 more than doubling profit from the first three months of 2016 when crude prices fell to the lowest level in more than a decade the company also generated enough cash to pay for new investments and dividends an increasingly important measure of resilience for big oil companies which have been piling on debt chevron corp which reported a quarterly loss last year on friday posted a profit of 27 billion the rosy results came a day after french energy company total sa reported a 77 rise royal dutch shell plc and bp plc which will report next week are expected to show sharp increases the improvements are the latest in a winning run of firstquarter earnings this month for large companies including google parent alphabet inc which reported a 29 jump in profit  thursday and general motors co which on friday reported a 34 increase  thanks in part to strong us sales of pickup trucks and sportutility vehicles financial companies also generally had strong quarters including bank of america corp which earlier posted a 40 profit increase for the big oil companies the gains reflect a rally in oil prices from last years lows and revenue from new projects that have come online after years of multibilliondollar investments in farflung places including angola qatar australia canada and russia they also highlight severe belt tightening by companies that have been retooling strategies as they brace for a potentially extended period of challenging oil prices these companies are cutting their cost structures said brian youngberg an energy analyst at edward jones they are leaner and have managed to get more out of each dollar they spend and it is showing in their results earnings growth for oilandgas companies could have hit double digits in the first quarter of 2017 said joseph tanious senior investment strategist for bessemer trust when oil prices were dipping lower that was having a drag on the overall results for the s 500 he said now were seeing the opposite of that in the us companies also face the prospect of less burdensome regulations under president donald trump who signed an executive order on friday to ease restrictions on offshore drilling  that order however is expected to have limited immediate impact experts said because current prices still make drilling in the arctic ocean and other affected areas economically unattractive still major oil companies face significant challenges as they attempt to repair the damage done by the worst price crash in a generation among the five largest western energy giants net debt more than tripled in the past five years to about 214 billion as they borrowed to make ends meet  balancesheet woes were among the reasons many were downgraded  by ratings firms exxon for instance lost its triplea rating  from s global ratings last year for the first time since the great depression chevron sold assets to generate enough cash to pay for new spending and dividends but new projects are likely to bring the company closer to exxons performance later in the year as more money flows in chevron is likely to spend it reducing its debt ratio of about 24 chief financial officer pat yarrington said friday its an ok place to be she said over time id like to see us move a little lower in the debt profile optimism from the relatively strong quarter has been tempered by growing concerns over whether a frenzied return to us drilling will once again swamp markets as oil prices recovered in the past year to prices above 50 a barrel us oil companies returned to shale fields  at a breakneck pace the number of rigs operating has more than doubled from a year ago according to rigdata us production has risen to about 93 million barrels a day just 3 shy of the 2015 peak according to rystad energy the increase has been driven in part by lower costs that have improved drilling prospects in a number of fields as well as positive sentiment stemming from a production cut from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries still some investors and market analysts are concerned the pace of the us return to drilling has been too hot raising the prospect that new shale production could bring so much new supply prices will remain mired around 50 a barrel for years volumes are growing particularly driven by north america said jeff woodbury exxons vice president of investor relations that factor and

put a kitten in your tank big oil gets less bold exxon mobil and chevron quarterly results show a shifting emphasis that will affect big oils results in future commodity cycles big oil the moniker attached to the giant multinational energy companies is slightly less apt than it was a year ago even as the industrys financial fortunes have improved exxon mobil corp and chevron corp reported firstquarter earnings  on friday that collectively were 56 billion or 416 higher than a year earlier driven by a big rise in crude prices but they were both less oily and less international than in the past crude output fell at both companies reflecting a major retrenchment in capital expenditures and a greater reliance on natural gas overall hydrocarbon production was down for exxon and roughly flat for chevron but both companies only saw growth domestically largely from shale formations  the change reflects a deliberate shift in strategy while neither company has abandoned mammoth technically challenging international projects unconventional us production is attracting more of their money even as overall spending has plunged the key attraction of doing this is the much lower exploration political and financial risk since there are no dry holes a capricious government wont nationalize fields and the investment spigot can be turned off if commodity prices tumble the downside is that much smaller companies can do the same thing often with less financial discipline  for now the news is good for both exxon and chevron they are finally generating enough cash to rebuild their weakened balance sheets and to perhaps resume their onceprodigious share buybacks in the longer run though big oils resemblance to small shale may mean skimpier returns across the next cycle write to spencer jakab at  spencerjakabwsjcom get financial insights and commentary on global investing from the wall street journals heard on the street team subscribe to the podcast 
exxon chevron earnings point to industry recovery the worlds biggest oil companies are seeing their highest profits in more than a year an early signal that they may be turning a corner on their long path to recovery exxon mobil corp on friday reported its best quarter since 2015 more than doubling profit from the first three months of 2016 when crude prices fell to the lowest level in more than a decade the company also generated enough cash to pay for new investments and dividends an increasingly important measure of resilience for big oil companies which have been piling on debt chevron corp which reported a quarterly loss last year posted a profit of 27 billion the rosy results came a day after french energy company total sa reported a 77 rise royal dutch shell plc and bp plc which will report next week are expected to show sharp increases for the big oil companies the gains reflect a rally in oil prices from last years lows and revenue from new projects that have come online after years of multibilliondollar investments in farflung places including angola qatar australia canada and russia they also highlight severe belt tightening by companies that have been retooling strategies as they brace for a potentially extended period of challenging oil prices these companies are cutting their cost structures said brian youngberg an energy analyst at edward jones they are leaner and have managed to get more out of each dollar they spend and it is showing in their results earnings growth for oilandgas companies could have hit double digits in the first quarter of 2017 said joseph tanious senior investment strategist for bessemer trust when oil prices were dipping lower that was having a drag on the overall results for the s p 500 he said now were seeing the opposite of that in the us companies also face the prospect of less burdensome regulations under president donald trump who signed an executive order on friday to ease restrictions on offshore drilling that order is expected to have limited immediate impact experts said because current prices still make drilling in the arctic ocean and other affected areas economically unattractive still major oil companies face significant challenges as they attempt to repair the damage done by the worst price crash in a generation among the five largest western energy giants net debt more than tripled in the past five years to about 214 billion as they borrowed to make ends meet balancesheet woes were among the reasons many were downgraded by ratings firms exxon for instance lost its triplea rating from s p global ratings last year for the first time since the great depression chevron sold assets to generate enough cash to pay for new spending and dividends but new projects are likely to bring the company closer to exxons performance later in the year as more money flows in chevron is likely to spend it reducing its debt ratio of about 24 chief financial officer pat yarrington said friday its an ok place to be she said over time id like to see us move a little lower in the debt profile optimism from the relatively strong quarter has been tempered by growing concerns over whether a frenzied return to us drilling will once again swamp markets as oil prices recovered in the past year to prices above 50 a barrel us oil companies returned to shale fields at a breakneck pace the number of rigs operating has more than doubled from a year ago according to rigdata us production has risen to about 93 million barrels a day just 3 shy of the 2015 peak according to rystad energy the increase has been driven in part by lower costs that have improved drilling prospects in a number of fields as well as positive sentiment stemming from a production cut from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries still some investors and market analysts are concerned the pace of the us return to drilling has been too hot raising the prospect that new shale production could bring so much new supply prices will remain mired around 50 a barrel for years volumes are growing particularly driven by north america said jeff woodbury exxons vice president of investor relations that factor and others indicate the need to be cautious going forward while a number of companies have managed to generate enough cash at that price to pay for new investment and

big oil gets in early on argentina shale shell exxon mobil and others who came late to the us boom are making a go at taking shale global n argentinaaround 5000 miles from the booming oil towns of west texas some of the worlds biggest oil companies are trying to do what they failed to do with us shale get in first and early royal dutch shell plc exxon mobil corp and others are making another go at taking the shale industry global starting with a grand experiment here in a desolate swath of western argentina this sprawling piece of patagonia known as vaca muerta which means dead cow potentially has as much oil and gas as the biggest basins in texas or north dakota replicating the us fracking boom elsewhere has taken on fresh urgency in an era of stubbornly low and volatile oil prices outmaneuvered early on in the us by smaller companies exxon shell chevron corp and others see argentina as one of their best opportunities to expand shale which generally features projects that can be ramped up or down with prices the vaca muerta has long been a focus of this sometimes quixotic quest but a businessfriendly government at all levels that is actively working to encourage drilling is fueling optimism that shale development in the region could finally begin to take off hurdles still remain and costs in argentina are significantly higher than the us but this time around the bigoil company executives are determined not to miss out hoping to leverage their big balance sheets and experience with foreign governments to make international shale work and they want to prove wrong critics who say they cant drill shale as well as specialists in the us our position is hell no we will show that we can drill and complete wells better than the best said andrew brown shells head of exploration and production were showing it in argentina this year exxon is expected to move from experimental pilot to proper development in the region taking a step toward investments that former chief executive rex tillerson last year said could exceed 10 billion in the coming decades frances total sawhich has repeatedly said that expanding its foothold in us shale is too expensiveis also planning to ratchet up production in the vaca muerta chevron has made investments of over 1 billion in argentine shale projects and bp plc is in the country through its joint venture pan american energy last month shell started up a new treatment plant on the vaca muertas dusty plains with the capacity to process 10000 barrels a day of shale oil and six million cubic feet of gas daily on a recent windswept afternoon a shell oilman stood atop a 560ton rig hauled over from the permian plains where it had recently been in use sporting a red firesafety suit and protective yellow gloves he pointed to a series of computer screens that spewed out data on the rigs effort to push thousands of feet of steel casing deep into the earth below senior drilling engineer wouter miedema who has worked in shale projects in the us and canada said he was struck by the similarities between the geology of the vaca muerta and the most productive shale fields of north america its amazing to think that on the other end of the planet youve got shale like this he said the expanse of irontoned dirt into which he was drilling is thought to hold 27 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil and 802 trillion cubic feet of gas embedded in a layer of shale that is up to 1700 feet thick according to the us energy information administration that ranks its geology up there with some of the best fields in the us executives and analysts say for now shell is investing under 200 million a year to see if it can make shale work in argentina it isnt enough to reach a level comparable with us shale though shell executives say the region could be a big producer major companies like shell were late to get in to shale production in the us when they did venture in they found the process to be different than the engineering feats that characterized other oil exploration and output still companies want to take it slow in argentina because they have been burned in the past their previous wildcatting attempts in shale from europe to russia and china have been stymied by a variable cocktail of poor drilling results political opposition regulatory hurdles and the dramatic drop in oil prices that began in 2014 argentinas shale is no sure thing companies have to spend more time and money figuring out the best places to drill in argentina where the vaca muerta is still relatively unexplored territory compared with the us shale patch on cost infrastructure and manpower it cant yet compete with the us according to shell steel casing here costs 40 more than it does in texas even though it is made in argentina casing accounts for up to 25 of well costs so that price difference makes drilling here much more expensive shell says in march exxon told analysts that it currently costs two to three times more to drill a well in the vaca muerta than it does in the us recent progress on costs has infused oil companies with hope about the vaca muerta including agreements with local unions and a government pledge to keep naturalgas prices high shells local well costs including drilling and completion have plummeted from about 35 million for their first well in 2012 to under 10 million now in february the company drilled a fivekilometer horizontal well for roughly 5 million the company said it was the cheapest of its kind ever tapped in argentina this will take off shell

blackrock vanguard mull pressuring exxon to disclose climate risks shareholder proposal would push oil company for a climate stress test gauging impact of green tech on its assets two of the worlds largest asset managers are strongly considering a public rebuke to exxon mobil corp over climate change at the companys annual meeting next week according to people familiar with the matter blackrock inc and vanguard group are weighing a vote in favor of an investor proposal that would seek to pressure the oil giant to conduct a climate stress test to measure how regulations to reduce greenhouse gases and new energy technologies could impact the value of its oil assets the people said exxon has urged investors to vote against the resolution if the proposal passes at exxons annual meeting may 31 experts say it would be the strongest signal to date that investors are seeking greater disclosure of the threats that climate change could pose to businesses passage would also highlight the emerging power of money managers with large passive investing businessesand their willingness to wield it five years ago many investors werent as attuned to how climate change could affect the value of assets but now the evidence just slaps you in the face said timothy smith a director at walden asset management which has pressured money managers on climate issues and is backing the exxon measure blackrock is still considering whether to support the proposal no decision has been made regarding our vote at exxons annual shareholder meeting our deliberations continue and we look forward to continued engagement with the company zach oleksiuk head of americas for blackrocks investment stewardship group said in a statement vanguard is also strongly considering a vote for the proposal the people said the asset managers could side with the company if exxon offers certain concessions including making further disclosures or agreeing to allow its nonemployee directors to meet with investors the people said such concessions in the past have led blackrock to side with companies and vote against proposals related to climate change disclosure directors at any company who dont engage with those on whose behalf they serve risk losing investor support glenn booraem a principal at vanguard who works on its governance efforts said in a statement while the votes are nonbinding companies need to show their responsiveness to such measures or face potential backlash including the prospect of institutional investors voting against their director candidates exxon in recent years has stepped up its climaterelated disclosures and voiced support for a carbon tax and the international paris climate pact but it has also come under investigation by the new york attorney general and the us securities and exchange commission who are examining whether it has provided enough information to investors about climate impacts  and the value of its assets the companys disclosures to date have concluded that its assets wouldnt be severely affected by climate change our view and those of all other credible forecasters show a continued role for oil and gas through 2040 said exxon spokesman alan jeffers investment products such as exchangetraded funds that track the performance of indexes often come at a lower cost than traditional mutual funds and have gathered assets at a clip in recent years that growth has given firms like blackrock and vanguard increasing sway on shareholder votes but the firms in turn have come under activist pressure to take stances on issues such as climate disclosure when blackrock sided with exxon and against a similar proposal at the companys annual meeting a year ago it faced backlash from investors and environmental activists this year blackrock said the disclosure of climate risks would be among its key engagement priorities with senior executives about two weeks ago the firm voted for a similar proposal at the annual meeting of occidental petroleum corp vanguard also voted in favor of that proposal a person familiar with the vote said following this months occidental vote exxon stepped up its outreach to large shareholders making executives available for extensive discussions investors said exxon has been very very active in lobbying over the past year said patrick doherty director of corporate governance at the office of the new york state comptroller which manages the states pension fund and led the investor coalition that put forward the climate shareholder proposal at exxon exxon has consistently said for years that it believes demand for oil and gas will rise in coming decades as people in emerging economies move into the middle class and drive cars or use air conditioning chevron corp the secondlargest us oil company has made similar statements but the issue has grown into a hotly debated topic in the industry with some european oil companies acknowledging the potential for demand to peak  by the end of the next decade in december a task force commissioned by the group of 20 richest nations and representing major asset managers laid out new guidelines for how companies should be more forthcoming about climate risks blackrock played a role in creating the recommendations the exxon vote appears to be shaping up as a litmus test for sustainability governance experts said at the end of the day the outcome will turn on what do the big fund managers and mutual funds do said anne simpson investment director for sustainability at the california public employees retirement system a backer of the

new york attorney general alleges exxon misled investors on climate state prosecutor claims exxon used internal climate risk figures that differed from public statements new yorks attorney general alleged in court papers friday that exxon mobil corp may have misled investors about how it accounts for the impact of climate change on its operations by using internal estimates that differed from its public statements disclosing for the first time some of the specific evidence his office has collected in its longrunning probe of the oil giant new york attorney general eric schneiderman claimed he found documents and other information showing that exxons process for estimating the potential future costs of greenhouse gas regulations on its business may be a sham he made the claims in a filing in new york state court seeking to compel exxon to release additional documents and produce witnesses for the probe which began in 2015 the us securities and exchange commission is also examining exxons accounting practices and climate change disclosures legal wrangling in the case  has also played out in federal court where exxon has alleged that the investigation by mr schneiderman a democrat is politically motivated and driven by company antagonists mr schneiderman has denied such accusations an exxon spokesman called the allegations inaccurate and irresponsible and said the company would respond in future court filings exxons external statements have accurately described its use of a proxy cost of carbon and the documents produced to the attorney general make this fact unmistakably clear spokesman scott silvestri said in a statement the company which has submitted nearly 3 million pages of documents in the case has strongly defended its disclosures and said its accounting practices are legal the airing of certain specific evidence in the probe comes a day after president donald trump said he plans to withdraw from the paris climate accord a 2015 agreement by more than 190 nations to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions in the past year exxon has repeatedly voiced its support for the climate agreement advocated for a carbon tax added an environmental expert to its board and begun testing technology to reduce emissions at power plants on wednesday the company suffered a public rebuke on climate when 62 of votes cast by its shareholders backed a resolution  to pressure the company to share more information about how climate change and regulations could affect its business at the center of the claims the new york state prosecutor made friday is one of exxons central assurances to investors on climate change risk that since 2007 the company has included a proxy cost of carbon in its assessment of the viability of its oil and gas projects that is an estimate of how much governments around the world may charge exxon or other companies or consumers for the carbon dioxide they emit through a carbon tax or other emissions fees such assessments can have a material impact on how an energy company values its assets with a higher estimated cost of carbon certain projects could become unprofitable potentially requiring an accounting write down or recognition of losses on a companys books mr schneiderman alleges that from 2010 to 2014 documents indicate the company used secret internal figures that understated potential future costs from climate regulations even while suggesting publicly that it used higher estimates the company said in a 2014 report that it applied a cost of 60 per ton of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 to its projects in developed countries the state prosecutor filed documents with the court friday that appeared to show it actually used a price of 40 a ton internally in 2010 an exxon employee identified as a corporate greenhouse gas manager said in an email that the 60 a ton figure used for exxons annual energy outlook was more realistic according to documents released with the filing another email in 2011 suggests that former chairman and chief executive rex tillerson now the us secretary of state was aware of the discrepancy between internal and external figures in part exxon was seeking to be conservative in its internal estimates according to the documents a state department spokeswoman said questions about the probe should be directed to exxon the company ended the practice of using different internal and external carbon cost estimates in 2014 the filing claims still documents produced in the investigation dont show that the company has a consistent process for coming up with such estimates according to the filing exxon may still be in the midst of perpetrating an ongoing fraudulent scheme on investors and the public mr schneiderman wrote he has broad powers to investigate allegations of corporate fraud and alleged wrongdoing under new york law the state accuses exxon of failing to provide documents associated with an alias email account previously used by mr tillerson under the name wayne tracker in addition it adds a new allegation that current exxon chief executive darren woods also had such an account under the name je gray exxon has said in filings that it has complied with court orders and objects to overly broad requests for information the documents appear to include a rationale for exxons use of a different internal estimate for potential carbon costs the sale of carbon credits exxon is involved in a number of projects in which carbon dioxide is captured and stored under some regulatory schemes such operations can generate revenue if the party storing carbon can sell credits to other emitters exxon this year wrote down the value of certain us natural gas assets and removed more than 4 billion barrels of crude mostly in canadas oil sands from its reserves total due to low prices the company has said its process of accounting for potential future climate costs helps ensure it will be prepared in the event that regulation or new technology slows demand for oil whatever environment we find ourselves in we will be competitively advantaged mr woods reiterated at the companys annual meeting wednesday write to bradley olson at

exxons accounting draws fire new yorks attorney general alleged friday that exxon mobil corp may have misled investors about how it accounts for the impact of climatechange regulations on its operations by using internal estimates that differed from its public statements disclosing for the first time some of the specific evidence his office has collected in its longrunning probe of the oil giant new york attorney general eric schneiderman claimed that he found documents and other information showing that exxons process for estimating future costs of greenhousegas regulations on its business may be a sham he made the claims in a filing in new york state court seeking to compel exxon to release additional documents and produce witnesses for the probe which began in 2015 the us securities and exchange commission is also examining exxons accounting practices and climatechange disclosures an exxon spokesman called the allegations inaccurate and irresponsible and said the company would respond in future court filings exxons external statements have accurately described its use of a proxy cost of carbon and the documents produced to the attorney general make this fact unmistakably clear spokesman scott silvestri said the company has said its accounting practices are legal in the past year exxon also has repeatedly voiced its support for the paris climate accord and backed a carbon tax at the center of the claims the new york state prosecutor made friday is one of exxons central assurances to investors on climatechange risk that since 2007 the company has included a proxy cost of carbon in its assessment of the viability of its oil and gas projects that is an estimate of how much governments around the world might charge exxon or other companies for the carbon dioxide they emit through a carbon tax or other emissions fees such assessments can have a material impact on how an energy company values its assets with a higher estimated cost of carbon certain projects could become unprofitable potentially requiring an accounting writedown or recognition of losses on a companys books but mr schneiderman alleges that from 2010 to 2014 documents indicate the company used secret internal figures that understated potential future costs from climate regulations even while suggesting publicly that it used higher estimates the company said in a 2014 report that it applied a cost of 60 per ton of greenhousegas emissions in 2030 to its projects in developed countries the state prosecutor filed documents friday that appeared to show it actually used a price of 40 a ton internally in 2010 an exxon employee identified as a corporate greenhousegas manager said in an email that the 60 a ton figure used for exxons annual energy outlook was more realistic according to documents released with the filing 
exxon rebuts allegations it misled investors on climate ny attorney general claims company deceived investors on climate risks exxon mobil corp pushed back on friday against accusations that it misled investors on how it accounts for climatechange risks saying in a legal filing that the claims by new yorks attorney general are inflammatory reckless and false the oil giant was responding to a motion filed by new york attorney general eric schneiderman in state court last week that seeks to force exxon to turn over reams of additional documents to aid the states ongoing probe of the company as part of that motion mr schneiderman said he had found evidence suggesting that the way exxon evaluates the impact of future climate regulations on its business was a sham mr schneiderman claimed exxon has used two sets of estimates for potential future carbon pricesa public number given to investors and another internal figure used privately for decisionmaking that could mislead investors by making exxon seem more resilient to potential climate risks than it really is he argued in its response friday exxon acknowledged that it has used varying carbon price figures in the past but said the numbers were used for different purposes one process the one used in an oil outlook shared publicly involved estimates of potential future carbon costs to assess energy demand and future prices while another the one used internally related to gauging the profitability of specific oil and gas projects exxonmobils use of different metrics in different circumstances to accomplish different goals evinces prudent financial stewardship applying appropriate assumptions in appropriate cases exxons lead lawyer ted wells of law firm paul weiss rifkind wharton garrison llp wrote in the brief there is nothing untoward or surprising about any of this mr wells reiterated exxons claim that the investigation by the attorney general a democrat is politically motivated saying he has been working backwards from an assumption of exxon mobils guilt searching in vain for some theory to support his prejudgment the state has a substantial basis to suspect that exxons proxy cost analysis may have been a sham said amy spitalnick a spokeswoman for mr schneiderman this office takes potential misrepresentations to investors very seriously exxons arguments underscore the challenge new yorks top prosecutor may face in asserting that the company is guilty of fraud in how it has accounted for climate risks regulations on such disclosure are in the early stages of being developed and many oilandgas companies have been slow to make changes or meet increasing investor demands for transparency on the subject exxon and mr schneiderman have repeatedly crossed swords over how exxon has complied with the investigations subpoenas mr schneiderman has alleged that exxon is attempting to stall and delay the progress of the probe he has argued that despite a subpoena issued in late 2015 when the investigation started exxon appears to have permanently deleted emails used by former chief executive rex tillerson under the alias wayne tracker new chief executive darren woods also had an alias account under the name je gray although he doesnt appear to have used it documents in the investigation show exxon has acknowledged that several months of emails from the alias account of mr tillerson now us secretary of state were inadvertently deleted but said it was able to recover most of the requested documents the company has submitted nearly 3 million pages of documents for the investigation and asked the new york court to reject mr schneidermans pursuit of additional documents and information write to bradley olson at  bradleyolsonwsjcom

how earthquakes are rattling a dutch province atop one of the worlds richest gas troves dutch government exxon and shell argue over production levels after damaging temblors prosecutor to open criminal probe groningen the netherlandsfor decades the giant groningen gas field beneath the flat green farmland in the north of this country counted among the greatest prizes for exxon mobil corp and royal dutch shell plc then the earthquakes started the exploitation of groningenthe biggest gas field in europehas been causing tremors for over two decades rattling a bucolic province with no previous history of quakes and exposing two of the worlds biggest energy companies to a criminal probe and rising reconstruction bills amid a public outcry the dutch government has imposed increasingly strict limits that have more than halved groningens gas production since 2013 now authorities are proposing another 10 cut in hopes of further reducing earthquakes and a dutch public prosecutor is preparing to open a criminal investigation into responsibility for the earthquakes shell and exxon are pushing back through their joint venture nederlandse aardolie maatschappij bv or nam the venture says cutting output even more is out of proportion and not effective and would create uncertainty about the legal framework for its operations it warns that continuous changes to the production level may ultimately threaten the businesss profitability nam said it is considering formally contesting the governments decision it also expressed surprise at the dutch court order to the prosecutor to open a criminal investigation this year since the authorities had previously found no grounds for such action the state will take a decision on whether to prosecute once the investigation is complete groningen was expected to be one of the worlds largest gas producers for decades to come last year it made up almost 10 of both exxon and shells total gas production globally and its reserves are among the companies largest undeveloped resources moreover the fields profits have been lucrative for the dutch government which not only collects taxes from nam but is also a 40 stakeholder in the field since production began the field has generated almost euro300 billion 335 billion for dutch coffers exxon named restrictions on groningen as a factor contributing to a nearly 4 decline last year in its global naturalgas output shell said groningen issues were largely responsible for a decline of 636 billion cubic feet in proven reserve estimates for its european joint ventures equivalent to nearly 2 of the companys total gas reserves at the end of 2016 under the current arrangement the government bears 64 of the costs related to compensation to residents efforts to reinforce buildings lawsuits and other items it isnt the first time seismic activity has caused controversy in the energy industry a us debate has raged for years over whether water injection related to drilling has caused earthquakes in oklahoma and texas earthquakes like the ones in groningen are less known and less understood groningens quakes were first officially linked to gas production in the 1990s nearly 30 years after work on the field began decades of production have caused pressure in the porous ground containing the gasbearing reservoir to decrease according to the shellexxon venture and the dutch government that increased the stress on natural faults resulting in the earthquakes the company and government say the tremors have caused widespread damage though no deaths in a province of nearly 600000 people a large majority of the temblors registered low magnitudes of between 15 and 2 and early on nam dismissed them as little more than a nuisance but the public and authorities snapped to attention in 2012 when an earthquake of magnitude 36 rippled through groningen province the regions homes and infrastructure built on flat land werent designed to withstand even such low seismic instability the tremors occur where groningens gas liesjust under 2 miles below ground level that relatively shallow depth and more significantly the soft claylike topsoil in much of the region make for stronger ground movements than expected from earthquakes of such magnitude according to the netherlands state supervision of mines which regulates gas extraction the impact on the houses and streets is a split second there are no rocks in between said hans alders a dutch government official appointed to oversee efforts to strengthen and repair the provinces buildings and infrastructure in a 2015 report the dutch safety board said nam and the countrys ministry of economic affairs failed to act with due care for citizen safety and didnt adequately research the risks posed by earthquakes the government said it has recognized that mistakes have been made and has implemented the reports recommendations nam hasnt disputed the findings and has made several public apologies it has acknowledged liability for earthquakerelated damage and paid out hundreds of thousands of euros in compensation poured millions more into a fund to stimulate the regions flagging economy and put aside more than euro1 billion mostly for a program to strengthen and repair buildings in the area the bill is expected to grow nam said while it would meet all its liabilities it isnt possible to predict the exact costs of strengthening and repair in the years ahead the gas company could also be on the hook for nearly euro8 billion to fully compensate residents throughout the region for losses to property value and psychological damage said pieter huitema a groningen lawyer who brought two successful civil suits on those issues nam is appealing both lawsuits and said all numbers relating to the size of potential liabilities are unsubstantiated the company said it already has a system to compensate residents for lower property values and needs more clarification on how to establish psychological damages both shell and exxon said they are confident nam could produce gas safely safety is and always has been our primary focus exxon said in an email the earthquakes have unexpectedly persistedalbeit at a lower leveldespite the dutch restrictions on groningen output that unpredictability and a belief that nam failed to present an adequate plan to mitigate it prompted the dutch regulator to recommend the further output reduction earlier this year jelle van der knoop president of the residents association groninger bodem beweging said many residents want gas production to end altogether the sooner they stop the sooner there will be no earthquakes mr van der knoop said write to sarah kent at  sarahkentwsjcom related coverage  quakes give province unwanted

us and exxon spar over russia sanctions violation treasury cites energy giants dealings with russian oil executive in notice for 2 million fine the company says it will challenge findings washingtonthe us treasury department on thursday imposed a 2 million fine on exxon mobil corp for what it called a reckless disregard of us sanctions on russia while secretary of state rex tillerson was the oil giants chief executive a finding the company immediately began to challenge exxon under mr tillerson  in early 2014 deepened the companys longstanding partnership with the kremlin despite washington levying sanctions against russia for annexing crimea and supporting prorussia separatists in eastern ukraine in may of that year the treasury department said the company signed eight documents relating to oil and gas projects in russia that were also signed by igor sechin chief executive of the state oil giant pao rosneft the treasury said thursday those deals violated us sanctions against mr sechin  a former russian intelligence officer and ally to president vladimir putin mr tillerson who had close business ties to russia  and received an order of friendship award from moscow left exxon last year to become us secretary of state the 2 million fine the treasury said was the maximum amount it could levy against the company a spokesman for exxon called the fine outrageous and said it would fight the treasurys findings saying they are a 180degree turn from previous guidance handed down by the obama administration when the sanctions were enacted the treasurys sanctions unit started its probe of the alleged sanctions violation several years ago exxon said it was first notified in 2015 by the sanctions unit the office of foreign assets control that it had violated sanctions regarding its interactions with mr sechin in a filing in a texas court thursday the company said it had challenged the notification about a month later exxon doesnt have any direct deals with mr sechin but does have business dealings with rosneft where mr sechin signed company documents in his capacity as ceo exxon said according to the company under president barack obama the

available today the justice department declined to comment about exxons legal challenge the us treasury said in an enforcement notice against exxon that the company showed reckless disregard for us sanctions requirements when failing to consider the warning signs associated with dealing in the blocked services of someone under us sanctions the treasury unit said one of the aggravating factors it considered was that exxon is a globally sophisticated company that routinely deals with sanctions compliance concerns no materials issued by the white house or the department of the treasury asserted an exception or carveout for the professional conduct of designated or blocked persons nor did any materials suggest that us persons could continue to conduct or engage in business with such individuals the thursday notice said when mr tillerson took his position in president donald trumps cabinet this year he promised to recuse himself from matters involving exxon for one year he has

matter to exxon spokeswoman heather nauert said thursday that mr tillerson is committed to the objectives of the ukrainerelated sanctions she said the state department wasnt involved with the decision to fine exxon she said mr tillerson is living up to his ethical commitments including his recusal from exxonrelated matters rosneft spokesman michael leontiev said signing an agreement with mr sechin not as an individual but as a representative of rosneft management cant be the foundation for a sanctions violation i am sure that while exxon was preparing the decision about documents signing it consulted with both ofac and lawyers specialized on sanctions very carefully he said the penalty comes as committees in the senate and house of representatives as well as a justice department special counsel investigate what us intelligence agencies say was a kremlinbacked campaign to interfere in the presidential election and whether there was any collusion between the trump campaign and russia russia has denied meddling and mr trump has denied any collusion exxon mobil caused significant harm to the ukrainerelated sanctions program objectives by engaging the services of a sanctioned entity the treasury said exxon applied to the treasury department for a partial waiver from russia sanctions in 2015 the application was never acted upon at that time but was again circulating among government departments earlier this year the trump administration said in april that it wouldnt grant the waiver  two days after the application was reported by the wall street journal  exxon and other big energy companies also recently joined mr trump in voicing concerns about congressional efforts to toughen sanctions on russia arguing that it could shut down oil and gas projects around the

investors to big oil restrain yourselves exxon shell bp chevron are under pressure to show they can keep spending under control three years into an oilprice slump investors want the worlds biggest oil companies to do something they have historically struggled with maintain some financial discipline the companies are under pressure to show they are continuing to move on from budgetbusting projects once common in the industry as they head into secondquarter financial disclosures that begin on thursday with royal dutch shell plc and total sa shell total and peers such as exxon mobil corp and chevron corp which both report earnings friday have reined in spending through an oilmarket downturn during which crude prices fell from 114 a barrel to 27 a barrel and remain about 50 a barrel those efforts paid off in the first quarter when the companies returned to billiondollar profits  after years of losses or anemic earnings now said jags walia senior portfolio manager at dutch pensionfund manager apg asset management theres no room to take your foot off on capital discipline i think that would be quite unforgivable said mr walia whose fund invests in several large oil companies including exxon shell and bp plc it is a call for big oil companies to keep their businesses steady in a tricky financial environment international oil prices were up nearly 10 in the second quarter compared with the same time last year but prices are still likely too low for many companies to cover spending and dividends with cash or break even at the same time the companies have to keep finding new oil to replace the barrels they are pumping that means spending money on exploration development and acquisitions bp which reports earnings next tuesday faced criticism from investors and analysts after a flurry of acquisitions inflated its investment plans for 2017 and pushed up the oil price at which the company could break even  to 60 a barrel the companys shares fell 4 after the february announcement it has since said it is working to drive down its breakeven oil price to between 35 to 40 a barrel by 2021 it isnt just bp the number of new projects approved this year across the industry is expected to creep up to between 20 and 25 from just 12 in 2016 according to edinburghbased consultancy wood mackenzie the oil companies declined to comment ahead of their earnings reports but they have moved to tackle the challenges bps costs are down 40 since 2013 and it has vowed to maintain a budget cap of 17 billion a year out to 2021 at bps firstquarter results in may chief financial officer brian gilvary said the company intended to deliver on promises to increase cash flow and dividends in coming years by maintaining strict discipline within our financial frame and staying focused on delivering returns exxons capital spending last year was 12 billion lower than in 2015 though it has crept higher this year the company says it is focusing a chunk of its firepower on shale developments that start to generate cash quickly chevron has said it will be able to cover its spending and dividends with cash at 50 a barrel this year with the help of asset sales in april chevron said it had lowered capital spending 22 compared with its average quarter in 2016 and 56 versus the average quarter in 2014 the company plans to spend 17 billion to 22 billion a year out to the end of the decade if oil prices remain near the 50 per barrel mark you can expect to see our future spend near the bottom of this range chief financial officer patricia yarrington told analysts in april the companies have said that they still have room to cut further and that they can start to invest in new projects  without returning to the spendthrift era that eroded returns before the oilprice crash in 2014 capital spending on new projects sanctioned so far this year is on average just 11 per barrel of oil equivalent down from 15 in 2015 according to wood mackenzie i think a lot of these companies have found religion said brian youngberg senior energy analyst at brokerage firm edward jones they realize now they cant just spend spend spend they have to be more disciplined with their capital exxon shell bp and chevron have all indicated they will be able to generate enough cash this year to cover spending and shareholder payouts at 60 a barrel but at 50 the picture is more mixed even next year many of them will still need higher oil prices to cover their costs according to analysis by macquarie investors remain cautious big oil companies share prices are little changed or lower than at the same time last year even though oil prices are higher for instance exxons share price is down more than 10 from a year ago the companies still have high debt levels and somelike shell and totaloffer dividends as company shares known as scrip helping them to preserve cash but also diluting investors earnings per share we need to see discipline and people being more realistic about where oil prices could remain for quite a long time said jason kenney an oilcompany analyst at spanish lender banco santander it is a tall order for an industry that struggled to break even when oil was at 100 a barrel and the challenge facing the companies could be more difficult after banks revised their oilprice forecasts downward  in recent months the goal posts have moved deutsche bank said earlier this month its time to go away and remodel for a 45 to 50 a barrel world write to sarah kent at  sarahkentwsjcom

hey big spender samsungs 44 billion splurge beats exxon and shell combined the tech giant spent more on capital expenditures last year than any other publicly traded company seoulsamsung electronics co spent more on capital expenditures last year than any other publicly traded company highlighting in dramatic fashion how technology and telecommunications firms are driving an uptick in manufacturing investment the south korean tech giant spent 44 billion in 2017 nearly doubling its investment in new or existing facilities making semiconductors displays and other products according to s global market intelligence estimates that put samsung atop the global ranking for the first time that sum is more than what royal dutch shell plc and exxon mobil corptraditionally two of the largest investorsspent combined last year and about 50 more than the next biggest tally petrochina cos 29 billion samsungs central role in the tech supply chain was put in focus tuesday when the company estimated  operating profits of 151 trillion won 141 billion for its fourth quarter that would mark the third straight quarter samsung smashed its earnings record even as its de facto leader lee jaeyong is in prison after a corruption trial that gripped south korea  samsungs big bets underscore a rebound in companies willingness to invest in boosting production in the future as 2017 brought an end to four straight years of global declines according to goldman sachs technology companies are projected to increase investment the most driving their spending is the proliferation of internetconnected gadgets and the need for skilled manufacture of dozens of microsize components the advance toward artificial intelligence calls for massive dataserver farms that require immense computing power and memory chips typically we think bigger is costlier said henrich greve an entrepreneurship professor at insead in singapore but with technology there are so many things that are very very small but also quite costly that has put samsung the worlds largest smartphone maker in a position to cash in the company is also a supplier  to the likes of apple inc dell technologies inc hp inc and sony corp whose smartphones laptops and televisions rely on samsungmade parts samsung has no choice but to invest like this said avril wu research director at dramexchange which tracks semiconductor sales and prices   they still have to invest in order to secure more market share but such capital expenditures may not translate into job creation in part because hightech factory jobs

capital improvements us telecom giants at inc and verizon communications inc along with apple google parent alphabet inc and intel rank among the 25 biggest investors according to the s global market

over the next three years according to a goldman report in october tech is expected to lead with a yearly increase of more than 10 from 2017 to 2020 goldman said companies optimism is also fueled by economic growth in europe us tax and regulatory changes that could spur wage and job gains and a chinese infrastructure initiative that promises strong commodity demand said sree ramaswamy a partner at the mckinsey global institute samsungs 44 billion in capital spending will largely go toward boosting production of flexible smartphone displays and memory chips that store photos on smartphones and give devices their multitasking speed a recent shortage of those types of memory chips has caused prices to rise dramatically and that has given samsung enormous clout in the global tech supply chaina position it must not abuse experts say samsung is behaving like a central bank said cw chung a seoulbased analyst at nomura they have to avoid inflation but also deflation samsung wants to avoid too much of a shortage or an oversupply a samsung spokesman declined to comment beyond what the company has publicly disclosed over the past two years the prices of two main types of memory chipsone for content storage known as nand and another enabling speedy multitasking known as dramhave both more than doubled according to dramexchange samsung controls nearly half of the dram market and more than onethird for nand but industry analysts are mixed on how long samsungs memorychip magic will last morgan stanley downgraded samsung in november expecting some chip prices to slide this year samsung in october said about twothirds of its 2017 capital expenditure was earmarked for semiconductors and roughly a third for displays but beyond that has offered few specifics the company said it would spend 144 trillion won 135 billion on a new nand factory in the coastal city of pyeongtaek by 2021 while investing 6 trillion won in a new semiconductor production line in hwaseong but it didnt elaborate on timing or product samsung is also adding a production line to its nand plant in xian china though it has yet to provide any details after ranking no 1 globally in expenditures

us sanctions low oil prices doomed exxons russian projects withdrawal from joint venture brokered by tillerson for now marks end of energy giants hopes of drilling in arctic ocean oil fields us sanctions against russia prevented exxon mobil corp from pursuing ambitious plans to explore for oil north of siberia but the final blow some experts said may have been delivered by lower oil prices the texas oil giant said in a regulatory filing late wednesday that it would walk away from the joint venture with statecontrolled pao rosneft to seek oil in the icechoked waters of the kara sea a hardfought deal signed in 2012 by the companys former chief executive rex tillerson now us secretary of state mr tillerson touted the agreement as a breakthrough giving exxon access to one of the worlds great unexplored oilandgas basins the company reportedly spent about 700 million to drill the first well likely making it the most expensive ever it struck oil according to rosneft but further exploration was halted because of us sanctions imposed by the obama administration following russias intervention in ukraine in 2014 exxon unsuccessfully sought waivers that would allow it to proceed in some areas in russiaa campaign that formally ended with president donald trump declining to waive sanctions  for the companys rosneft ventures last year the us also added new sanctions on moscow last year for its alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election but in the meantime something else happened oil prices plunged and the global chase for new supplies changed the deal was struck when oil prices topped 90 a barrel and prospects for them remaining high seemed likely oil is now trading at just over 60 a barrel and many companies including exxon are pursuing shortercycle projects such as drilling in the permian basin of texas and new mexico that can deliver returns more quickly a highrisk arctic project that maybe looks good at 100 oil does not look like anything anyone would touch at 60 said edward chow a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington dc i think that is a fundamental to the exxon decision exxon declined to comment on the reasons for its decision the company said it would formally begin to withdraw from the rosneft joint ventures this year taking a 200 million loss after taxes rosneft said in a statement carried by russian news agencies that it would support the return of exxon to the projects in the future if it were legally possible drilling an offshore well in a remote arctic region is technically and logistically complex every piece of equipment needs to be brought in from hundreds of miles away through inhospitable weather royal dutch shell plc ended a 7 billion exploration effort in the seas north of alaska in 2015 after prices fell and one of its drilling rigs ran aground in foul weather exxon ceo darren woods who took over after mr tillerson resigned to become secretary of state has steered the company in a new direction in a bid to reverse slumping oil output and financial struggles he plans to triple production in the permian basin and has touted vast new discoveries off the coast of guyana in south america exxon is still heavily invested in russia via an oil project off the pacific island of sakhalin that predated the us sanctions in 2016 the company produced 234000 barrels a day of oil from russia and the caspian sea region about 10 of its output but given the state of usrussia relations it was unlikely work on the other deal that mr tillerson brokered would recommence anytime soon the joint venture between exxon and rosneft included exploration in the kara sea as well as other collaborative efforts in russia and the us exxon funded the exploration work entirely earning a 333 stake in any discoveries its a combination of financial decision making but also recognizing that the riskreward balance is out of whack in russia right now said ken medlock director of the center for energy studies at rice university in houston if we were in a 120 oil world i highly doubt this decision would have been made a former us official who worked on the issue said there was little interest among policymakers to allow a project like exxons venture in russia to proceed current and former officials also said mr tillerson after his appointment as secretary of state had been careful to recuse himself from exxonrelated matters including the russia deal im not surprised they pulled out the former official said of exxon there are legitimate economic reasons they would want to pull out if oil prices rise and sanctions are removed there is nothing stopping exxon from rekindling its relationship with rosneft experts say it is unlikely rosneft will be able to find another company able to step into exxons roleeither due to european sanctions or a lack of technical capabilities to drill offshore wells thus exxons decision and the sanctions will slow the kremlins efforts to unlock significant new resources that could help russia maintain its position as the worlds largest crude producer russias federal budget relies on oil and gas sales for around onethird of its revenues without technology from partners such as exxon russia will struggle to access those resources analysts say although it has plenty of other onshore fields to maintain

officials at the state department some of whom felt that mr tillerson often ignored their policy advice many senior staff have departed and several top positions that require senate confirmation remain vacant about onethird of the 152 key positions at the state department requiring senate confirmation have no nominee of 28 undersecretary and assistant secretary posts that run much of the building only 10 are confirmed the trump administration hasnt nominated anyone to fill many of the remaining posts as mr tillerson approached the oneyear mark last month aides close to him declared him the secretary of stay reflecting their belief that he appeared to have survived the tensions but as the white house gears up for important diplomatic initiatives including mr trumps agreement to meet north korean leader kim jong un the president decided it was time for a change according to officials white house chief of staff john kelly awoke mr tillerson late friday night while he was on a trip to africa to let him know he would likely soon be fired officials said mr tillerson cut the trip short and returned to washington early tuesday shortly after mr trump tweeted that he had

rex tillersons golden parachute top diplomats time at the state department earned him some nice tax benefits on his exxon shares rex tillerson is having a bad day but a glance at the share price of exxon mobil might make the day of his firing a tad better mr tillerson the firms longtime chief executive was dumped as secretary of state  just over a year after taking office one bright spot for him is a law that makes it more financially attractive for people joining the executive branch to sell investments to comply with conflictofinterest rules the law allows an individual to sell his or her shares and put them into permitted property such as treasury notes or a diversified mutual fund but to defer the taxes indefinitely on the sale this benefits people like mr tillerson who had large concentrated investments in this case roughly 52 million in exxon shares   his appointment proved to be an excellent time to diversify exxon shares have lagged behind an s 500 index fund by more than 29 percentage points since his confirmation last february selling when he did has left mr tillerson 15 million better off than he otherwise would have been an even bigger benefit came from exxons decision to place his 180 million in deferred compensation   to be received over a decade into a diversified trust rather than exxon shares if he had been forced to pay tax upfront on the compensation  before joining the government the bill would have been roughly 70 million and if he had left it in exxon stock rather than the diversified trust that would have cost him on paper 50 million or so there were some benefits that mr tillerson gave up without getting compensation he forfeited an exxon credit card that would have given him discounted gas for life even if the discount was a buck a gallon though and he drove a gasguzzler worthy of a wealthy texas oilman his tax and diversification boon is worth about 23000 years of cheap fillups write to spencer jakab at  spencerjakabwsjcom

buy the rights from a liberian oil operator whose ownership was murky then exxon would buy a controlling stake in the project from the canadian outfit according to the london presentation documents outlining the deal and people familiar with the matter exxon completed the deal for 120 million in 2013 there is a growing body of us and european laws aimed at stamping out corruption around the world and they have been aggressively enforced the exxon transaction shows the extent to which companies are structuring deals to try to minimize the risks of government scrutiny this account of what exxon learned about potential red flags and what it did in response is based on interviews with three people directly involved in the negotiations and a review of transaction and bank documents detailing the movement of funds some of the documents were provided by global witness a londonbased organization that investigates corruption which released a report  on the deal thursday the journal

will be less likely to flow illegally to public officials the uk in 2010 passed a law called the bribery act a close cousin to the us foreign corrupt practices act which bars public companies from bribing government officials to gain an advantage over competitors in 2010 as exxons chief executive mr tillerson lobbied against a new federal requirement that required energy and mining companies to

at law firm marcus neiman rashbaum llp who specializes in whitecollar crime and us anticorruption laws said federal investigators often take interest when corporate money reaches politicians in highrisk jurisdictions such as liberia however criminal liability only attaches if exxon or its representatives knew about corrupt payments and somehow participated he said the liberian government under newly elected president george weah is reviewing nocals audit reports and the bidding processes that led to the auctioning of oil blocks said eugene nagbe liberias minister of information culture and tourism in an email if any corruption activity is found to have taken place the perpetrators will be brought to justice he said mr sirleaf who said he has worked for 24 years in finance

their means said adam flikerski managing partner at blackgold capital management lp an asset manager that specializes in oil and gas lending like technology companies the smaller players are still rewarded for growth the wary response from the worlds biggest producers comes as a global oil glut  that has hung over the industry for the past four years finally appears to be withering away without steppedup spending on new oil production the international energy agency warns the world could flip from abundance to supply crunch by 2020 still many investors in publicly traded oil and gas producers are pressing executives not to sow the seeds of another price crash with excessive growth their apathy about oils rally has shown while the price of brent crude the international oil benchmark is up around 11 this year a leading barometer of energy stocks the msci world energy index is only up around 4 a number of companies have performed even worse exxon is down 39 the pace of share buybacks has been a key factor for performance so far conocophillips shares rose 3 thursday after the company disclosed it had repurchased about 500 million in stock as it reported that quarterly profits jumped 52 to 888 million exxon fell 34 friday after announcing that it hasnt yet reinstated its longstanding program for buying back shares exxons net income rose 16 to 47 billion but production fell 6 to below 4 million barrels a day after an earthquake in papua new guinea knocked out natural gas production in the country revenue rose 16 to 68 billion although the company posted its highest cash flow since 2014 it still fell short of analyst expectations for the second straight quarter and shares fell 34 friday chevrons profit rose 36 to 36 billion while output rose 65 to the equivalent of about 29 million barrels a day its shares rose 18 friday after it reported revenue surged 13 to about 38 billion executives at exxon and chevron said they continue to weigh whether to reinstate share buybacks a longstanding practice they discontinued after the 2014 price collapse but said paying dividends and reinvesting in attractive prospects are higher priorities buybacks remain on the table said jeff woodbury exxons vice president of investor relations we are intensely focused on value shells uk shares fell 07 on thursday after the company missed cash flow expectations and failed to give more clarity on when it would begin buying back 25 billion in stock as it reported quarterly profits rose by twothirds to nearly 6 billion one reason for caution among larger companies is that some analysts investors and executives still lack faith that crude prices will remain elevated through the end of the year theres potential weakness on the horizon in oil prices said tom ellacott senior vice president for corporate research at wood mackenzie its still quite an uncertain environment smaller us producers are exercising less caution as many of them still have business models akin to startups they must invest in new wells to prove the viability of new prospects those companies are a major reason why forecasters say us oil output may reach 11 million barrels a day by the end of the year surpassing the output of saudi arabia in february companies that arent among the top us crude producers made up almost half the permits approved for new drilling according to data and analytics firm drillinginfo in the past six months those operators accounted for about 42 of permits permits are generally a useful barometer for future drilling activity many such companies will be affected by shortages in labor and trucking as well as pipeline bottlenecks in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the heart of us drilling activity those challenges could curtail production by about 400000 barrels a day but output will continue surging as many companies have secured the supplies and contracts needed to meet their goals said artem abramov vice president of analysis at rystad weve got a completely new generation of small private players with very ambitious growth plans in the permian basin he said those plans will continue write to bradley

the incredible shrinking exxon oil majors must resign themselves to easier pickings but lower returns as a result of the shale revolution as exxon mobils results illustrate exxon mobil put an exclamation point on what ails big oil on friday never mind the immediate reaction to its slightly tepid firstquarter results despite just announcing its 36th annual dividend increase in a row the total shareholder return of the worlds largest publicly held oil company is flat over the past year even as crude prices have rallied  by over 50 one needs to look back a bit farther in time to explain that dichotomy a decade ago at the dawn of the shale boom exxons stockmarket value could have paid for tech giants apple amazon and what was then called google and had 100 billion in change left over the energy sector made up 14 of the s 500 today it is barely 6 and exxon is worth less than half as much of any one of those technology titans individually demand isnt the issue global crude consumption is up by 16 over a decade and naturalgas demand has risen even more instead it is the economics of producing oil and gas that has changed for decades giant oil companies such as exxon chevron bp and shell have been blocked from the most lucrative oil fields which are controlled by stateowned firms like saudi aramco the shale revolution  in north america gave private companies an opening to boost production with much less risk than in the past exxon chief executive darren woods put it well last year that part of the business  isnt in discovery mode its in extraction mode but a lower bar means lower returns  too exxon just registered its best return on invested capital since 2014 the last time crude prices reached triple digits yet 2017s figure was barely a quarter of what it managed a decade ago exxon is still playing to its strengths as a capital allocator with promising megaprojects in guyana brazil and papua new guinea it also is integrated so refining and chemical profits can smooth out the cyclicality of commodity production taking big exploration risks still pays off but now exxon is taking fewer of them the result is the rewards to shareholders are more modest get used to it write to spencer jakab at  spencerjakabwsjcom

for its audience with pope francis exxon tries on a new hue green the energy giant criticized by environmentalists and subject to government probes faces challenges in trying to reset its climate stance exxon mobil corp the oil giant long derided by environmentalists is trying to give itself a green facelift chief executive darren woods has called for exxon to become part of the solution on climate change a point he is expected to make saturday as he and other oil and gas executives meet with pope francis at the vatican to discuss the issue the company has flooded the airwaves during the nba playoffs with advertisements touting its research into fuels made from algae it pledged last month to cut its methane emissions 15 by 2020 exxon is now calling for global action to address climate change and it has begun publicly promoting a us carbon tax it is part of an evolving shift by exxon under mr woods after some of his predecessors adopted a more adversarial stance on climate and environmental issues with governments and activists the oil giant faces investor pressure to disclose the potential impacts of climate regulations on its business as well as lawsuits by new york and others alleging exxon foresaw the consequences of rising temperaturespublic battles that have forced the company to defend its reputation exxon faces many challenges as it seeks to shift the narrative on its climate record for one it isnt really changing its business model while peers such as bp plc and total sa are investing in renewables  and diversifying into other energy businesses   exxon remains almost entirely focused on oil and gas its research projects are oriented toward mitigating the impact of fossil fuels and may take years to gain traction exxon is taking a very narrow path on its green makeover relative to other companies said peter bryant managing partner at consulting firm clareo they arent building energy optionality the companys research aim is to find technological breakthroughs that will help meet the worlds growing energy needs and reduce emissions exxon executives dont see traditional renewable energy project investments as having that kind of potential officials say we see our role as helping close the gap between what people want and what can be responsibly done mr woods told investors at exxons annual meeting last week the new posture has been years in the making but it represents a significant aboutface for exxon which in 2000 ran a newspaper ad questioning the unsettled science on global warming and whose pugnacious former chief executive lee raymond spoke out in 1997 against the kyoto protocol the international agreement to set global emissionreduction targets so far exxons technology investments are largely wagers on the future of fossil fuels for example for algaemade fuel to ever be used in cars or trucks the internal combustion engine must continue to hold sway in the market the need for algaerelated biofuels to be processed also could theoretically preserve some of the value of exxons refineries experts say mr woods last week disclosed the limited scale of exxons algae research the program has the potential to produce 10000 barrels a day by 2025 mr woods said that is less than half of one percent of exxons global refining capacity they are putting their best foot forward to the general public but at the end of the day exxon is a very conservative disciplined company said bob sullivan managing director of consulting firm alixpartners while it can be attractive to make big bets in renewables right now its still an uncertain market with a lot of volatility theres a lot of risk of making bad bets as exxon positions itself as an energy company of the future it is also wrestling with legal challenges forcing it to address its past the new york and massachusetts attorney generals offices continue to investigate how the company has accounted for the impact of climate change on its business exxon has submitted more than three million pages of documents and asserted the investigations are part of a conspiracy to punish the company and limit its free speech a new york federal judge in march said exxons claims were based on extremely thin allegations and speculative inferences and dismissed the companys lawsuit  seeking to quash the investigation reducing greenhousegas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions exxon spokesman scott silvestri said lawsuits such as those the company is facing simply do not do that in addition a number of cities including san francisco oakland and new york have filed lawsuits against exxon and other companies seeking damages for the costs they expect to incur building sea walls and other projects that will be needed because of climate change a federal judge is expected to rule in coming months on whether the san francisco and oakland suits merit a trial following a motion to dismiss by the companies the zeal with which exxon has fought the cases which have included efforts to subpoena or seek testimony from environmental groups and public officials may undermine its attempt to strike a more conciliatory public stance on climate issues said amy myers jaffe an energy fellow at the council on foreign relations exxon has a reputation for aggressively defending itself in the courts and this has been no exception she said but in this case it will make their effort to turn a corner all the more challenging write to bradley olson at  bradleyolsonwsjcom

exxon once a perfect machine is running dry ceo darren woodss plan to make a comeback by spending more on fossilfuel projects has so far proved unpopular the chart on oil and gas production is in millions of barrels a day an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated in the chart that production was in billions of barrels a day july 13 2018 darren woods spent a year preparing an ambitious plan to return exxon mobil corp to glory struggling with laryngitis the oil giants chief executive stepped before a ballroom full of analysts and investors at the new york stock exchange in march and unveiled a strategy to spend more than 230 billion to double profits and pump an additional one million barrels a day of oil and gas as mr woods walked away afterward and peered at his phone he received an unwelcome surprise shareholders didnt buy it our stock is down 3 he said to another executive looking exasperated exxon faces a number of challenges including investigations of its accounting  and tax practices as well as lawsuits by cities and states  seeking funds to pay for the effects of climate change its biggest problem is one the giant has seldom faced in its 148year history it isnt making as much money as it used to under former ceo rex tillerson exxon bet big hunting for oil in risky expensive locales like the russian arctic but as oil prices fell those projects didnt pay off the way exxon had hoped now the 350 billion irving texas company is returning to its old ways big disciplined spending on prospects that make money at low oil prices the approach is a gamble in a new era of energy breakthroughs such as fracking and electric vehicles many of exxons competitors are transforming their businesses to move away from oil exploration and have begun to spend carefully and diversify into renewable energy investors who once looked past exxons tendency toward arrogance and secrecy because of its good returns arent sure they want big oil to get bigger most investors like exxon but they like other companies better said mark stoeckle chief executive of adams funds which owns about 100 million in exxon shares the market is not willing to reward exxon for spending today in hopes that it will bring good returns tomorrow exxon has been pledging to produce more oil and gas for years but its output of about four million barrels a day is no higher today than it was after its merger with mobil corp in 1999 even if exxon succeeds in doubling last years earnings of 15 billion excluding impairments and tax reform impacts by 2025 as mr woods vowed in his eightyear spending plan it would still be making far less than in 2008 when it set what was then a record for annual profits by an american corporation at 45 billion in 2016 s p global ratings stripped exxon of the triplea credit rating  it held since 1930 it was one of only three companies to hold the distinction at that time along with microsoft corp and johnson johnson while exxon once ranked as the worlds largest company by market value it was 10th as of june 30 less than half the size of apple inc through a spokesman mr woods declined to comment exxon declined to make other executives available for interviews exxon has denied wrongdoing related to the climate litigation and other probes it is facing and insisted the lawsuits are the wrong way to deal with climate change the company traces its history back to standard oil the name oil titan john d rockefeller gave to his powerful monopoly to signify control order and uniform quality the us supreme court broke up the monopoly in 1911 exxon the largest descendant of that monopoly bears a resemblance to standard oil even now while a powerful ceo sets the companys direction exxon is ultimately run by a committee of a handful of executives dubbed the god pod by employees much as it was in mr rockefellers time they divide oversight responsibility over exxons vast reach which now spans 51 countries and six continents and includes more than 70000 employees it became the biggest public company in the world by revenue in 1975 and over the next 3 decades it was often the most profitable even when oil prices were low exxon excelled in coming through on budget and as scheduled in projects rife with political and engineering complexity the companys process included a painstaking analysis of all decisions major and minor projects were judged based on an assumed oil price often as much as 50 or more below current or forecast prices according to more than a dozen former employees and executives its leaders confidently steered the company through oil crashes foreign conflicts and clashes with wall street lee raymond exxons boss from 1993 to 2005 personified the swagger at the heart of the companys ethos he was notorious for making fun of or criticizing the questions of wall street analysts often to their faces and he was equally dismissive of some shareholders at annual meetings that style rankled some rivals and investors but exxon backed it up with bestinclass performance exxons stock traded at a premium to its peers for decades a trend that intensified after the companys purchase of mobil investors at times recognized twice the value in exxons assets compared with rivals bp plc total sa chevron corp and royal dutch shell plc for years exxon operated like a perfect machine said uday turaga a former conocophillips executive who now runs consulting firm adi analytics it is a processdriven extremely disciplined organization about a decade ago mr raymond was succeeded by mr tillerson a folksy texan who came from the socalled upstream side of the business which explores for and produces oil and gas and who had a penchant for personally negotiating big oilproduction deals himself as prices rose to alltime highs of almost 150 a barrel mr tillerson led the charge to chase more expensive prospects that could meet the worlds thirst for crude he looked to canadas oil sands natural gas fracking and even russias arctic all of which required higher prices to be profitable those efforts largely failed exxons production has declined in the past five years and the company has delivered lackluster financial results today oil prices are around 74 a barrel mr tillerson who left in 2017 for a shortlived stint as president donald trumps secretary of state produced returns of about 6 a year during his tenure including dividendsfar less than the s p 500 or rivals chevron and shell in that period according to factset mr tillerson didnt respond to requests for comment in need of a chief executive who could return exxon to its prior gloryand who could help exxon confront a multitude of critics and a new energy landscapethe board turned to the 53yearold mr woods a tall whitehaired electrical engineer originally from kansas mr woods came up through the ranks of exxons refining division where profits come from squeezing pennies out of every barrel he is an enthusiastic believer in the companys traditions in one of his first public presentations as a top executive given in 2015 to a labor conference in the dallas area he repeatedly praised the companys risk and accountability methodology known as the operations integrity management system he mentioned the wonky acronym oims 13 times in a short speech as he prepared to take the reins from mr tillerson more than a year ago he held a series of dinners with close advisers according to people familiar with the meetings at one dinner he received a query what if exxon is wrong in its view of a bright future for fossil fuels what if the greatest risk to the company is hubris mr woods acknowledged the threat the company faces from shale drilling electric vehicles and climate hawks according to a person familiar with the discussion renewable energy opportunities werent yet profitable enough to compete with other exxon projects mr woods said when they are the company will be ready for now he added the best way forward was for exxon to do things the exxon way his faith in exxons process was one of the top reasons he was selected by the board to succeed mr tillerson according to people familiar with the decision among the companys recent challenges exxon wound up miscalculating the political risks of doing business in russia which came under us and european sanctions in 2014 and walked away earlier this year from joint ventures with statecontrolled pao rosneft to drill for oil in the black sea and arctic waters last year the company was forced to acknowledge that 36 billion barrels of reserves in canadafrom an oil sands project that cost more than 20 billionwere no longer profitable to produce another blunder analysts say was the 2010 purchase of xto energy inc one of the pioneers of modern fracking exxon bought the company for more than 30 billion when natural gas prices were higher than they would be at any point over the next seven years in the past two years exxon has written down the value  of its us natural gas assets which include its xto unit by 25 billion an unusual step for the company in 2015 mr tillerson told trade publication energy intelligence that at exxon we dont do writedowns exxons fracking prospects in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico developed by its xto unit remain among its most profitable opportunities the company says still its us drilling business has lost money in 11 of the last 15 quarters mr woods has taken several steps to shake up exxons insularity embrace new risks and jettison less profitable areas people familiar with the matter said exxon is weighing reducing its exposure to canada where it has operated for 130 years getting oil from canadas oil sands is expensive and the prospect of reduced exposure has signaled to some advisers that the company may become more aggressive in seeking transformation the company is also developing a more robust trading operation with an eye toward using regional oil and gas price disparities in the us and around the world to boost profits according to people familiar with the process still the centerpiece of mr woodss turnaround effort is a major increase in spending much of which is focused on drilling in brazil papua new guinea mozambique and texas in march he said such opportunities are the best exxon has seen since its merger with mobil they will make it possible for the company to produce an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day he said combined with existing production that would equate to five million daily barrels a record for exxon next year exxon is set to spend 28 billion 45 more than in 2016 thats a marked difference from rivals such as chevron which is holding investment levels flat this year and 18 below

looking for big change darren woods is turning the exxon mobil supertanker but the scale of the challenge is giant said mr sankey now an analyst at mizuho energy exxon is poised to rebound in three to

big oil profits fall short of crudeprice rally exxon chevron and others have also been slow to share their substantial excess cash with investors the worlds largest oil companies continue to disappoint investors with limited cash payouts and profits that have failed to match the rally in crude reflecting the fragile nature of a recovery from one of the worst price crashes in a generation exxon mobil corp said net income rose to 4 billion for the apriljune quarter up 18 compared with the same period a year earlier but substantially below the 50 oilprice increase in that threemonth stretch the companys production fell to 36 million barrels of oil and gas a day the lowest in more than 20 years due in part to an earthquake in papua new guinea and a shift away from less profitable us natural gas drilling secondquarter profit at chevron corp more than doubled to 34 billion and the company said it will begin buying back about 3 billion in shares annually the results at both companies fell well short of wall street expectationsthe thirdstraight quarterly miss for exxonalthough chevron shares rallied on the buyback announcement while exxon shares declined they are disappointing the market said brian youngberg an analyst at edward jones you keep thinking the worst is over but then they lay another egg exxon executives sounded a rare note of contrition for the results vowing to address issues  that led to unexpected operational challenges senior vice president neil chapman who oversees the companys oil and gas production business emphasized that exxons decisions on where to drill are based more on what is profitable than on growth targets were not focused on volume he said were focused on value he also said exxon is looking very hard at potential asset sales exxon chevron and other large companies have posted their highest secondquarter profits since 2014 when oil prices began a decline that bottomed out at below 30 a barrel yet as crude has recovered to about 70 a barrel many are still holding back on spending and shareholder payouts as they recover from the painful downturn together with european oil giants royal dutch shell plc bp plc and frances total sa the five largest western companies are set to generate about 90 billion in free cash flow in 2018 and 2019 exceeding records set in 2008 when oil sold for almost 150 a barrel yet they are paying out far less of their cash haul to investors in 2008 the five companies generated about 85 billion in excess cash the highest ever and bought back more than 50 billion in shares according to factset this year the buyback total is unlikely to exceed 15 billion about 17 of the free cash flow expected by analysts at the five companies the demand for more cash reflects shareholder skepticism about longterm oil and gas investments as oil prices rose above 100 a barrel many companies increased spending by tens of billions of dollars and failed to boost production or returns oil companies spent like drunken sailors in the last decade without generating great returns said mark stoeckle chief executive of adams funds which owns about 175 million in exxon and chevron shares investors now are much more interested in spending discipline and stock buybacks smaller oil and gas producers are paying out proportionally far more  and shareholders are rewarding them for it anadarko petroleum corp which has a market capitalization of 37 billion bought back almost 3 billion in shares from september to march the company announced it would buy back an additional 1 billion through june 2019 including reinvested dividends anadarko shares are up 62 in the last year more than double the average increase among large companies like exxon and chevron shells shares fell by more than 3 thursday after the companys quarterly profit fell short of expectations the company announced a buyback  of 25 billion through 2020 yet some shareholders were disappointed that only 2 billion shares will be repurchased in the next two months analysts said bp shares were little changed friday after the company announced plans to spend 105 billion  to buy most of the us shale business of bhp billiton ltd exxon which bought back tens of billions of dollars in shares annually when oil sold for more than 100 a barrel before the crash has yet to return to largescale buyback programs the market loves capital discipline and shareholder returns said kris nichol an analyst at consultancy wood mackenzie ltd the majors so far have been adhering to capital discipline but they havent been on the front foot in terms of shareholder returns write to bradley olson at  bradleyolsonwsjcom 
slouching tiger why exxon isnt worth its premium the world has changed for the oil major and its strengths are no longer necessary to make big returns in the energy business for decades it was the very model of a modern supermajor but exxon mobils edge over the rest of big oil is slipping  and probably will continue to do so in the past year for example exxons shares have trailed those of each of its global peersshell bp chevron and totalto the tune of 27 percentage points on average even after that it is valued at a 43 premium to those peers on enterprise value to projected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and a 22 premium on forward earnings according to factset data this is the portion of a commentary when the writer typically laments how management lost its way but that makes for too neat of an explanation and not a terribly accurate one the factors that are forcing exxon from its perch are mostly beyond its control yes it also made some unfortunate decisionsfor example buying xto energy in 2010   during a time when some rivals made better deals but the main cause of its malaise is that its longsuccessful strategy of capital discipline and the advantage of immense size are becoming less relevant exxons management has been called brash over the years ignoring the baying crowd mostly served it well though it didnt slash investment when the world soured on oilandgas exploration and it remained restrained during boom times its capital budgeting set a high hurdle rate for new projects by assuming oil prices would be below market forecasts while requiring a high return on its shareholders money if it didnt meet that bar then it returned the cash this quite literally paid dividends in the 12 years following its merger with mobil ending in 2012 exxon paid out 318 billion in cash to its owners exxons market value today is just 345 billion during those years it had an average return on invested capital of over 359 percentage points higher than its big oil peers on average but the shale revolution has changed that by leveling the playing field and shortening the investment cycle exxons roic since 2012 has not surprisingly been a much lower 116 there are still big rolls of the dice to be made of course exxon has made a huge discovery in guyana and is betting on conventional projects in brazil papua new guinea and elsewhere it also is making promising energy infrastructure investments along the us gulf coast if history is any guide it will manage these projects well but as the oilandgas business becomes more like manufacturing and less like wildcatting what made exxon special is fading that premium it earned over the decades will keep fading too
