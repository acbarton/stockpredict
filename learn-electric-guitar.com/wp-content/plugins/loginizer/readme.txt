Pro Features :

* PasswordLess Login - At the time of Login, the username / email address will be asked and an email will be sent to the email address of that account with a temporary link to login.
* Two Factor Auth via Email - On login, an email will be sent to the email address of that account with a temporary 6 digit code to complete the login.
* Two Factor Auth via App - The user can configure the account with a 2FA App like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
* Login Challenge Question - The user can setup a <i>Challenge Question and Answer</i> as an additional security layer. After Login, the user will need to answer the question to complete the login.
* reCAPTCHA - Google's reCAPTCHA can be configured for the Login screen, Comments Section, Registration Form, etc. to prevent automated brute force attacks.
